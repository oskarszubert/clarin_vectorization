The deeds count, not the words, so I will not promise anything. I live in Bemowo in Warsaw. I walk the same streets, do shopping in the same shops and I have the same problems as other residents. I will be trying to make a better living in my city.I am honest, consistent, ambitious, hardworking and independent.I want to change the world and help people solve their problems.I am young but I have a lot of experience and my education is related to cultural policy, media and soliciting funds from the European Union.
