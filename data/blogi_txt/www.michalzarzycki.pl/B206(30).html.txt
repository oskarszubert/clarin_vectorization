A report from Hamburg – students exchange31.05.2012 | kategoria: English    On the first day of our journey – it means on the 8th of May 2012 – we went to Hamburg by a small bus. Our journey started at 3 o’clock at night when everybody was present. The bus was waiting for us in front of the school. Our journey took 16 hours. It was a long trip, so everybody was sleeping. The time passed quickly. I took my guitar with me, so I was playing in the bus. When we arrived in Hamburg we were really tired. I met my friend’s family in front of his school. Going to their house, I told them about my journey to Hamburg. Next day, my friend and I went to his school to meet the other pupils and teachers. After a while we went into the hall. Polish children had a big surprise there. The German and the Polish children had to play a funny game, just to know better each other. For example, my friend’s name was Lucas, so he took a lollipop. Then we went to the centre of Hamburg and we visited it. I saw this city for the first time and I liked it very much. In the evening we went to the disco. We were dancing and singing. It was a nice evening. On the third day we came to school and I had PE. Lucas’s friends are very sympathetic and funny. In the afternoon we visited some museums in Hamburg. We visited a park where there were many famous objects but much smaller than natural. Then we had some free time. The girls went to the shop. Me and Lucas were waiting for them in front of it. After the girls did shopping we went to McDonald’s. We were talking and laughing all the time. After a few hours we came back home. Next day we had chemistry. The teacher let us see a film about animals. It was a little boring. After watching the film we went to the centre of Hamburg again to see a ships parade. About 1.5 million people live in Hamburg. Over 1.5 million people came to Hamburg  to watch it. Then we had free time again and this time we went to have nice ice creams. Coming back home we were playing games on the big meadow full of flowers.    The last day was the worst for me because we had to say good bye. It was a great journey. I will never forget it!
