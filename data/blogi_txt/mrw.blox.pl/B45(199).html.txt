Back in the 90's Alanis Morissette had the song that was named something like, "Isn't it ironic?" The song listed several things that weren't ironic at all and called them ironic. One such example was "Rain on your wedding day." It's not very ironic. A blind optometrist is ironic. It was nonetheless popular and parodied widely as being wrong.But come on. It's about irony, and yet nothing in it was ironic.So I ask you, Isn't it ironic?Źródło - teh internets
