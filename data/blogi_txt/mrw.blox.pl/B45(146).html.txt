Można je wydać na prawdziwą sztuczną laskę , ale można i na innego robota. Hello Kitty!  08/17/2007 - by Katherine Lover from Springfield, VT USThe description says it all here. $6000 is kind of a lot for a Hello Kitty toy (as a beta tester I got a small discount), but this little sweetie is a high-tech marvel.As a single executive mom, I spend most of my home time on the computer and phone and so don't have a lot of chance to interact with my 18-month old. The HK robot does a great job of talking to her and keeping her occupied for hours on end. Last night I came into the playroom around 1AM to find her, still dressed (in her Hello Kitty regalia of course), curled sound asleep around the big plastic Kitty Robo. How cute! (And, how nice not to hear those heartbreaking lonely cries while I'm trying to get some work done.)The speech capability is remarkable, and it's nice to have a caretaker talking to my child without a foreign accent.One complaint -- this thing is heavy (the description says 14 pounds but it feels heavier, more like a couple of gallons of milk), and the little one fell down once trying to get her Robo up the stairs. It's pretty tough though, and only has a little crack for the tumble (not bad considering it was about 10 hardwood steps onto marble tile!)Anyway, Robo is a lifesaver, and (to me, anyway), well worth the purchase. Yes, I had to sacrifice a bit to buy it, but nothing unreasonable. If it could only change those stinky overnight diapers I'd fire the day nanny too and put Kitty in charge round-the-clock.Five stars!
