Przepraszam za dwie pasty pod rzÄ…d, ale czasem trzeba. Znalezione na 4chan, autor - anon:  Hi. James Cameron here. Call me MIJ. Have you heard about my new film, Avatar? When I was a child I loved to draw blue people, but my electical engineer father was completely unsupportive in any way, shape or form. He would call them them "stupid blue sea monkeys." Upset one day, I went into our living room and read a pamphlet on how to build a fallout shelter and I became obsessed with nuclear apocalypse. I continued to draw my blue people. But my father was always sharpening his knives, waiting for me to fail so he could say "Aha! I was right! You should have gone into engineering!" Why did my father hate blue aliens so much? My father gave me zero support in my dreams to create blue people. It made me so angry. He never told me I could do anything I wanted. He always doubted me. I HAD to succeed. It made me so mad. I had to prove that I was right, not my stupid engineer father. I had to make myself get good. Survive. By creating blue people. Well who's laughing now DAD???  MOAR
