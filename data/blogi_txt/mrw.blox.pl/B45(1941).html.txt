[...]After all, from a geek's point of view, Red Dwarf is the ultimate expression of the North-South class divide: its creators like to tell themselves that it's a working-class comedy about a Northern slob who happens to be the last human being in the universe, whereas everyone in the South knows that nobody working-class would ever watch the bugger, and that its audience is mostly composed of middle-class polytechnic graduates who believe in the power of nob-jokes to make sci-fi seem less desperately uncool. Of course, I myself am a geek. So imagine my distress when - about six weeks ago, now - I took the bus ride to my local emporium of trading-cards, comic-books, and exotically-shaped dice, only to find the shop closed and the building surrounded by TV cameras. It turned out that Red Dwarf was being shot there, which doesn't bode well for the programme, if it's sunk to the level of making self-referential jokes about its own fanbase (q.v. the excressential "Trio" episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, not to mention the two-dimensional nerd-boy in the "Blink" episode of Doctor Who, whom Moffat elected to call "Lawrence" for some unimaginable reason). But which is the geekiest thing of all? A geek-programme making jokes about geeks? A geek having an opinion about a geek-programme making jokes about geeks? Or a geek having an opinion about a geek- programme making jokes about geeks, after being irritated that his local geek-shop was closed because a geek-programme was making jokes about geeks there?Â Sause: Lawrence Miles
