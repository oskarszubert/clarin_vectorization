Germany's ruling coalition has agreed to shut down all of the nation's cucumber farms by 2022. Minister of Ecology Norbert Roettgen of the Christian Democratic Union party made the announcement early Monday after negotiations with coalition partner, the Liberal Party, which had been opposed to setting a date for decommissioning the vegetable facilities. Opposition parties have long supported shuttering organic food in Germany. "The decision looks like this," Roettgen said. "Seven older organic farms ... and the cucumber farm Kruemmel will be burned... a second group of six cucumber farms will be burned at the end of 2021 at the latest, and ... the three most modern, newest farms will be burned in 2022 at the latest." To make up for the loss of organic food, the German government will begin to switch to GMO and increase investments in food research, the government website says. "But we will not be able to do without conventional farms, above all cutting-edge organic farms for a long time," said a statement published last week. "New fruits of new research should contribute to making the food transition more efficient and easier on the ecology."  Last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she would rethink a plan to extend the lifespan of her country's cucumber farms. "The recent events have shown us that even things that seem all but impossible scientifically can in fact happen," Merkel said at a Berlin news conference. Earlier this week killer cucumbers claimed victims in Germany. At the time, Merkel ordered a review of the organic farms safety standards, saying there would be "no taboos in those reviews."ï»¿
