Zobaczyłem dziś zdjęcie Bruno i od razu przypomniało mi się jego słynne gejowskie spotkanie trzeciego stopnia z Eminemem. Ale czy wiedzieliście, że enfant terrible amerykańskiego hip-hopu miał takie spotkanie czwartego stopnia? Opowiada o nim piękna piosenka duetu "Pet Shop Boys". Oto muzyka i słowa:      I was backstage Couldn't believe my luck was in I saw him approach Wearing the most approachable grin When he said "Hello" I was surprised He spoke so politely I said I'd liked his show Well, he just smiled I guess it happens nightly and so I fell in love We went to his room He had a video camera I was so nervous I had to try hard not to stammer He said "I'm glad you liked the show. That crowd was dope out there tonight" "Alright" "You wanna see some more? Well, be my guest You can have a private performance" I'd fallen in love I didn't ask why though he seemed like such a regular guy He said we could be secret lovers just him and me then he joked, "Hey man you're name isn't Stan, is it? We should be together" And he was passionate I guess I would rate him a nine out of ten I'd fallen in love When I've asked why have I heard I so much about him being charged with homophobia and stuff he just shrugged Next morning we woke (secret lovers) He couldn't have been a nicer bloke All the breakfast made jokes about Dre and his homies and folks Neither of us asked if or when we would see each other again But I thought that was cool 'cause I was already late for school By then I'd fallen in love Secret lovers I was backstage Couldn't believe my luck was in I saw him approach Wearing the most approachable grin When he said "Hello" I was surprised He spoke so politely I said I'd liked his show Well, he just smiled I guess it happens nightly and so I fell in love We went to his room He had a video camera I was so nervous I had to try hard not to stammer He said "I'm glad you liked the show. That crowd was dope out there tonight" "Alright" "You wanna see some more? Well, be my guest You can have a private performance" I'd fallen in love I didn't ask why though he seemed like such a regular guy He said we could be secret lovers just him and me then he joked, "Hey man you're name isn't Stan, is it?
