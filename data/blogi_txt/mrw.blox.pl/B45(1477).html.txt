Albo w wersji zarejestrowanej na albumie "Is there anybody out there":  Are there any paranoids in the audience tonight? Is there anybody who worries about things? Pathetic. This is for all the weak people in the audience. Is there anyone here who's weak? This is for you. It's call 'Run Like Hell'. Let's all have a clap! Come on, I can't hear you! Put your hands together! Have a good time! Enjoy yourselves! That's better!
