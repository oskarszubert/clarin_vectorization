Diabetophobia. Certain dysfunctions are considered sexy, or at least have positive connotations. Scar tissue can lend you a certain charm, a missing limb will give you an air of injured dignity, and dwarfism at least guarantees you work as an extra, but diabetesâ€¦ when I was younger, the only famous name who admitted to being diabetic was Harry Secombe, then in the most tortuously Christian phase of his career. A poster campaign was launched which listed the symptoms of diabetes alongside Secombe's face and the headline "Diabetes: It's No Joke", but when the poster was put up in the local shopping centre, someone scrawled the words YOU'RE ALL A LOAD OF POOFS underneath it. This has to be considered the strangest form of discrimination I've ever seen.Sause: Lawrence Miles
