Pacman is a tale about a man trapped in his own personal purgatory where he must reflect on the wrongdoings in his life. The ghosts are mental visualizations of people he has greatly wronged in the past coming back to haunt him, and no matter how much he tries to escape they will always come for him and make him suffer for as long as he tries to run away from the past. When he obtains the power-pill this is an obvious reference to turning to substances instead of facing your problems. When you obtain a power pill your troubled past can no longer hurt you but only whilst you're under its influence, the ghosts come back to haunt you after you've 'sobered up' so to speak. If you try to escape from the gaps in the side of the screen you're brought back to the other side showing that this cycle will repeat for eternity until you face your inner demons. Just look at Pacman, he's a circle with a piece missing, representing his incomplete self journey and him eating the pills littered throughout the maze is symbolic of him trying to find distractions and fill a void in his life. The only true way to win the game is to face your past head on and be set free from your entrapment in the maze of your mind, only then can you be whole again.sause: anonymous
