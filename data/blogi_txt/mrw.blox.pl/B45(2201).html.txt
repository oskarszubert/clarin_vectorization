On April 1st, Hot Wheels sent a message to our Facebook fans (http://Facebook.com/HotWheels) saying that we were going to show them a sneak peek of one of our 2011 New Models.  The image that we posted was of Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet.  The response to the joke was so positive that the fans asked for us to actually make it for real.   So, just in time for DC Comics' 75th Anniversary, Hot Wheels presents Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet!  Get it fast before it disappears!
