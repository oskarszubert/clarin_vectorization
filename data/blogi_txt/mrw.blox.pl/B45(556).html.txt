***Policy on sale of samurai swords*** 02 April, 2008 | 12:52PM BSTThe UK Government recently decided to ban the sale, manufacture, hire and import of samurai swords. While there are some exceptions to this general ban, we don’t think it’s practical to enforce a policy based on these. The sale of samurai swords on eBay.co.uk will therefore be completely prohibited when the new law comes into effect on 6th April.Regards,The eBay Team
