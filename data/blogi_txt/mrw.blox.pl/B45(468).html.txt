"Heatha Ledgera w swojej ostatniej w życiu roli - Jokera" - ładnie to brzmi dla narracji, tylko że to nieprawda.  Gilliam says, "I've seen it and it works and it's great. It's the last chance to see Heath and he's brilliant. It (filming) stopped for a bit until the three heroes, as they're now known - Jude Law, Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell - came to the rescue and finished off Heath's part."sause
