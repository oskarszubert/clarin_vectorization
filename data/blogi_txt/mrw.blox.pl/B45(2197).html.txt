What do you think of Samantha Darko, Donnie Darko's spin-off, and were you involved in this project?Richard Kelly: I have absolutely nothing to do with this project! I've been trying for a long time to prevent the producers from making this sequel that they made for money but there was nothing I could do. I haven't read the script, I haven't seen the trailer, I will never watch the film and I will never work with any of the actors or crew members involved in this. For me, this is pure betrayal. It is important that you write that I didn't have any control, absolutely none, over this story and that is just the product of mercantile guys. If I ever see it one night on television, I think I will make it explode (nervous chuckle). It's a horrible experience and I don't wish it to anybody who directed his first film.
