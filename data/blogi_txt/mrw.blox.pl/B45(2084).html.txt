(...) Traditionally, "nigger" has been used not only a racial term, but as a way of identifying the American underclass; we might recall that Pepsi was once referred to as "nigger cola", suggesting something cheaper and less acceptable than Coke. In a country without formal class barriers, skin-colour is always going to be the preferred way of marking out the haves from the have-nots, but this only works if you can be absolutely sure that nobody with Skin-Colour B is capable of falling into Social Bracket A. These days, "American underclass" covers almost everyone in the Western World, yet isn't guaranteed to cover any racial group in the US itself. We're all niggers now, although Condoleezza Rice obviously isn't.Źródło
