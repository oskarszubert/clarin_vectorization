DICK, Philip K(indred), 1928-1982. American pianist and composer, born Chicago, Illinois USA; died Stockholm, Sweden. Best known for avant-standard, "Blues for PE." Early collaborator with Ornette Coleman in 1950s, culminating in the Coleman-Dick composition, "Ubikityness," the side-long closer to Coleman's 1959 double LP, MUSIC FROM THE HIGH CASTLE, based in part on an unpublished, never-performed jazz-opera composed by Dick in 1955. Dick left the US shortly after HIGH CASTLE's release (to minor critical acclaim and neglible public acceptance) due to pressure from President Joseph McCarthy's Anti-American Activities group (AAA); Dick had been a minor member of the Berkeley Communist Party and reputedly helped plan the infamous Marin County Putsch in 1957. Fleeing to Europe, Dick recorded little but played frequently with other exiled American jazz artists such as John Coltrane, Gil Evans and Sonny Blount, with whom Dick created the spacey keyboard duo known as Sun Ra, recording the hard to find MARTIAN TIME-SLIP BLUES album. Dick finally settled in in Stockholm in 1972, the year of his final album release, TRICKY DICK, an elegiac tribute to recently assassinated American president, Richard Nixon. In 1971, Nixon extended a full pardon to all American expatriates, lifting the death warrant imposed by President Robert Kennedy in 1966. Dick chose never to return to the US and stopped composing when he entered a neo-Gnostic monastery outside of Stockholm in 1974, where he stayed until his death from heart failure in 1982.See also BLOUNT, SONNY; COLEMAN, ORNETTE; COLTRANE, JOHN; EVANS, GIL; and EXPATRIATISM. sause
