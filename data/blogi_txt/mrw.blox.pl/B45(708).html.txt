"Out on the road today, I saw a Dead-Head sticker on a Cadillac... a little voice inside my head said don't look back, you can never look back." So sang Don Henley in "The Boys of Summer", an anthem to the collpase of '60s idealism in the face of '80s consumerism. (The Dead-Head logo was a symbol of late-'60s counter-culture and anti-materialism, so to see it on a Cadillac is proof that the generation which produced both the Grateful Dead and the Eagles went terribly wrong somewhere.) But out on my road today - or at least, my local high street - I saw a six-year-old girl running up and down with a cardboard box around her midriff, informing her friend that she couldn't be chased because she was obviously in the TARDIS. Is this that "great new future" thing the American Democrats have been going on about all week?Sause: Lawrence Miles
