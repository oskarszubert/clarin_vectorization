[...]Construction began in 1987 with planned completion in 1989. However, after several delays, construction was eventually halted in 1992; the fall of the Soviet Union had resulted in widespread economic disruptions in North Korea and shortages of raw materials. In April 2008, after 16 years of inactivity, work on the building was restarted by the Egyptian company Orascom Group. [...] In July 2011, it was reported that the exterior work is complete. Features that Orascom has installed include exterior glass panels and telecommunications antennas.ï»¿ [wiki]
