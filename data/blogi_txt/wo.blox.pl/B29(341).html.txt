Wiem, że było, ale jakoś polska polityka zaklęta w nigeryjski spam nie daje mi spokoju i postanowiłem się odnieść blogowo w tej poetyce.DEAR SIR/MADAM,MY NAME IS JAROSLAW KACZYNSKI, I AM A BROTHER OF THE RECENTLY DECEASED PRESIDENT OF POLAND. YEARS AGO, MY AND MY BROTHER CAME INTO POSSESSION OF A CERTAIN EARTH SATELLITE. UNFORTUNATELY HIS TRAGICAL DEATH PREVENTS ME FROM RECLAIMING IT AS I HAVE NOW NO ACCESS TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE. YOU HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO ME AS A REPUTABLE BUSINESS PARTNER AND I HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THIS VALUABLE OBJECT. I NEED YOU TO DONATE ME 1 VOTE (ONE VOTE) IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THEN I WILL SHARE SOME OF THE SATELLITE WEALTH WITH YOU, BUT FIRST I NEED YOUR IDENTITY CARD (DOWOD OSOBISTY) PRESENTED TO YOUR LOCAL ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATOR. FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME:MR JAROSLAW KACZYNSKIMRJAROSLAWKACZYNSKI@YAHOO.COMLAW AND JUSTICE BLDGLAGOS, NIGERIA
