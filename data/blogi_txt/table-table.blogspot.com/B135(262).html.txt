My new everyday, delicious, no-knead, seeded sourdough Bread. World Bread Day 2013.        Here it is again. The World Bread Day (2013!). Such an amazing time when hundreds of home bakers 'meet' almost at the same time with their own tasty homemade loaves. As I am always honest with you my dearest Readers, I must admit I baked my bread on Saturday as I always do these days. Coming back to work is such an amazing experience but I need to be more flexible with my 'after work time' and baking one big loaf during the weekend works really well for me. I have decided to stick to easy recipes, the ones that allow me to leave my loaves on their own and do other stuff in the meantime. For the last past months I uesed this one (very easy and I highly recommend to give it a try) but then I re-discovered Basia's recipe. Basia is my very best friend and when she says that something is worth baking and tasting I do not ask any questions. I simply trust her. This bread is very easy. You do not have to knead it, you can use whatever flour you like and is full of seed. Once again please feel free to use your favourite mix and remember that you are allowed to adapt the recipe to meet your own needs.   When people are new to bread baking they tend to think that it is difficult and tricky and rather than having fun while baking they think of getting great results. Believe me or not but baking bread is all about having fun and trusting your senses. The most important thing is to use good quality well-sifted flour as it highly impacts the quality of the final loaf. Allow your bread to have a long, slow rise. Do not change the temperature drastically as bread does not like it. A long slow rise eliminates the need for kneading your sourdough bread as the wild yeasts and various bacteria in your sourdough starter will do the work for you. If you prefer to have a big holes make your dough wetter. Of course a drier one will make it easier for you but it has a different taste. Just simply adjust the amount of water to get the bread you like the most. Maybe consider reducing the very long proofing time by several hours? It all depends on the temperature and humidity in your room. Do not be afraid of doing this your own way and once again trust your senses. And then when your bread is ready take a comfy seat, have a slice or more and feel that energy and happines that fill you up.      NO-KNEAD, SEEDED SOURDOUGH BREAD |adapted from Basia with my changes to her original recipe|   2 cups whole wheat bread flour  1 cup bread flour  1/2 cup sunflower seed  1/2 cup flaxseed  1/2 cup buckwheat  1/2 cup oatmeal  1 tbsp salt  2 cups warm water  3/4 cup active sourdough starter (100% hydration)   Toast the mixed seeds for 10 minutes at 180C and leave them to cool. Set aside a handful, and put the rest of the seeds in a bowl along with the dry ingredients. Add the starter and water and mix everything well with a spoon until wet ingredients are well incorporated. Cover loosely with plastic foil and leave for proofing for about 4 hours, depending on the room temperature.  Place the dough into the oblong bread, 11x30cm, lightly greased and sprinkled with flour or lined with nonstick paper, smooth the top of the loaf with a wet spoon, brush with water, sprinkle on the reserved seeds, cover and leave until almost doubled in size. It should take between 3 and 4 hours, at 20C. At least 30 minutes before dough is ready, heat the oven to 175C. Bake the bread for about 80 minutes (do not remove loaf from the form) until is beautifully browned. Let cool completely on rack. Consume bread and be happy.      ------  Around the kitchen table | happiness is homemade. All rights reserved. Follow me on:      Autor: Around the kitchen table
