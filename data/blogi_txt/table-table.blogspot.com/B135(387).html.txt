Soy bean and linseed loaf from Bourke Street Bakery. World Bread Day 2011.              I am very happy to participate another World Bread Day hosting by Zorra. It is quite important day bearing in mind that some people are not able to have a fresh bread fort their everyday breakfeast.  Enjoy my recipe and have a wonderfull Sunday!   Baking is a part science, part stoneground milling and part river-running romance. But it's not the romance that will keep you baking consistently good, it's the science(...) Creating something from scratch is a beautiful thing. Being able to share your creation is a double pleasure. Baking at home for yourself or your beloved ones is always going to be well received. No matter what the outcome you can be sure that anything you make is going to be much fresher than what you can purchase in a supermarket(...) Patience in baking is not a virtue: it is a necessity. A good baker can control the dough if they can control the environment where the dough is created. However, sometimes with baking, as with life, things don't go to plan and you might have to follow the dough instead of leading it(...) Bread baking is half scienceÂ  and half wild creation, which is its beauty. If you think a loaf of bread is ready to go in the oven from the techniques you have learned, but the recipe says hold it back another 10 minutes, throw the little bugger in the oven: trust yourself. The worst can happen is that you learn a little more from the experience(...) Sourdough is the heart and soul of baking. Once people get a taste for sourdough, it's hard to turn back. If you are looking for a wholesome, natural bread that has a low GI, without preservatives or additives than sourdough is the bread for you. Making sourdough bread will take time, but the labour is well worth the effort. Paull Allam   David McGuinness 'Bourke Street Bakery'        SOY BEAN AND LINSEED SOURDOUGH LOAF*    Sourdough bread base  |makes 1.5kg - you need 890g for further recipe|    405g fresh rye starter 765g organic light rye flour  400ml water  20g sea salt    Put the starter in a large bowl with the flour and water. Mix together with a large spoon until it comes together to form a dough. Turn out onto a clean work surface and knead into a ball with your hands, for about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 20 minutes. Sprinkle the salt over the dough and knead it for a further 20 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  To check the dough has the required structure, roll up a little piece of dough and stretch it out to create a 'window'. If the dough tears at the slightest touch, it is under-mixed. What you want is to be able to strech out the dough to transparency.  At this stage the dough temperature should be 25-27C (77-81F).   Lightly grease a container with oil spray and sit dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at ambient room temperature for 1 hour to improve.   To knock back the dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and press out onto rectangle, about 2.5cm thick. Use your hand to fold one-third back onto itself, then repeat with the remaining third. Turn the dough 90 degrees and fold it over again onto thirds. Place the dough back into the container and continue to bulk prove for a further 1 hour.    Main loaf    100g cooked soy beans  500ml water  890g sourdough bread base (as above)  50g linseeds (flax seeds)  30g soya flour    After the second bulk prove turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and press out onto rectangle as before. Slowly sprinkle the linseeds over it and lightly mix in the cooked soy beans and soy flour. Gently knead the dough to make sure everything is well incorporated into a it.   Use a blunt knife or divider to divide the dough into two even-sized portion, about 500g each. Working with one portion at a time, continue to shape the loaves. Line two baskets with a tea towel, lightly dust both with flour and place a loaf inside each, seam side up. Place both baskets in the refrigerator loosely covered with a plastic bag for 8-12 hours.  Preheat the oven to its highest temperature.  Remove the covered loaves from the refrigerator and let them rest in a humid place until each loaf has grown in size by by two-thirds (this could take anything between 1 and 4 hours). If the loaves push back steadily and quickly when you push lightly into them with a finger then they are ready. Score the loaves and place in the oven.  Spray the oven with water and bake the loaves for 20 minutes.. then turn the loaves around, and bake for further 10 minutes, watching carefully to make sure that the loaves do not burn. Check the base of each loaf with a tap of your finger - if it sounds hollow. it is ready.  Baking should take no longer than 40 minutes in total.    Enjoy!    *Please note that I have slightly changed the original recipe from the book..
