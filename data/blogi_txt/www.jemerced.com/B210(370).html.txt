Jessy Mercedes I'm so glad that I had the opportunity to meet Bryan Boy - one of the biggest bloggers in the world! I remember, when I was reading two years ago an interview with him in the Polish ELLE magazine I completely fall in love with his character   his style and I was really impressed, about that what he achieved! I think he can be an authority for bloggers like me.  BLAZER TOPSHOP, T-SHIRT H M, NECKLACE ALE. via GALERIA YES, SKIRT DIY, HEELS JESSICA SIMPSON  Follow me on Fashiolista﻿
