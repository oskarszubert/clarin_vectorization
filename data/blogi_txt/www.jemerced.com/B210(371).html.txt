Jessy Mercedes Helloo guys! This is my new outfit in which one I had the pleasure to meet one of the greatest bloggers ever - Scott Schuman! I decided to wear something glamour and baroque. I was inspired by the amazing Miuccia Prada - she is such an inspiring designer - am I right?Check out my new amazing sunglasses! They are uncredibly chic and I totally fell in love with them! I bought them online on this cool online store called Sunglasses Shop! It was so hard to decide which model should I choose, because of their big assortment, but I found a perfect pair of Chanel sunnies, which fit so good on my face! What do you think about it? Let me know people and check out this store ;) http://www.sunglasses-shop.co.uk/ I WAS WEARING:    COAT - SHEINSIDE  TEE - TIDELAND  SUNNIES - CHANEL via Sunglasseshop.com  EARRINGS - H M BRACELETS - BLINGS.PL LEATHER GLOVES - WITTCHEN  BELT (WEARING AS A NECKLACE) - ANNA DELLO RUSSO FOR H M  SKIRT - HECTOR KARGER  BAG - D G  SHOES - SEQUIN.PL
