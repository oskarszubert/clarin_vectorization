Jessy Mercedes Custo Barcelona show was really breathtaking! This time Custo showed us a lot prints mixed with beige and silver. It was a little bit hippie, a little bit futuristic, but I loved it! The vibrant, colorful floral prints of the new collection, which will be an assortment of beautiful flowing tunics and body-con dresses, will be a must-have next Spring.The show was opening Andrej Pejic, he's such a cool model - bananas!Check out my picture with Custo Dalmau, the designer of Custo Barcelona Andrej Pejic
