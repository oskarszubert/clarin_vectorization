Jessy Mercedes I am 24 hours awake and I can't fall asleep, because I'm THAT excited!  ELLE   NOKIA made my dream come true and I went today to New York to cover Fashion Week. All the finalists of "The Search for the next style correspondent" and the judges have met in a nice restaurant for a dinner. We were eating, drinking, laughing and talking about everything. Thank you guys for such an amazing evening! Here are some pictures from today - on my way to the airport, on the roof of the car with Bonnie in NY or with the ELLE team and Bryanboy!
