Jessy Mercedes My second day in New Yor was so great, everyone was celebrating Fashion's Night Out! I spent the whole day running through New York, interviewing, visiting stores and meeting a great jewelery designer Anna Sheffield. Upon coming back to my hotel, I was that exhausted that I just fall asleep on my bed in my clothes, so I wasn't able to post anything! Here are some pics of my outfit, later I'm going to show you, what happend yesterday. I WAS WEARING: SEQUIN TOP - VINTAGENECKLACE - ALE. via GALERIA TECHNERING - ANNA SHEFFIELDSKIRT - HECTOR KARGERBAG - PRADAHEELS - ZARA
