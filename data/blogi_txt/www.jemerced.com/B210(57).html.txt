Jessy Mercedes I spend such a nice day with my dear friend Isabelle. We went to Brooklyn to some vintage stores and had an amazing lunch. After that we went to Upper West Side to test some products and have a make up for the 360 Style Party.  Well... You can see that I'm totally obsessed with silver and I'm wearing this colour in my every outfit! I am finally owning an incredible pretty piece from my favourite polish designer Krystof Strozyna - these with the silver zip fastener leggins are killers!
