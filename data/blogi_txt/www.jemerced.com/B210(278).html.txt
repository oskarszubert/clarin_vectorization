Jessy Mercedes I just want to share with some pics of my new stuff. I bought 2 pairs of shoes from American designers: one from Jessica Simpson and one from Calvin Klein. I received a few gifts last day. Anna gave me a necklace and an amazing two finger ring. The WESC Store gave me this cool baseball blouse as a gift. Thank you guys so much, you made my day!
