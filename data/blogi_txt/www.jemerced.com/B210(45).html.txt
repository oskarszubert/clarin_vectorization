Jessy Mercedes Long time ago, behind seven mountains, seven forests, across seven rivers, on the Old Continent in a beautiful kingdom, a blond, filigree girl of mesmerizing blue eyes was born. Since the very beginning she was called Mercedes. However her grandmother, who was not fond of that, wanted to change it, and had to compromise her mother. And that’s how SHE was born – Jessica Mercedes. When she was 2 she painted her nails just out of pure fascination of colors, a year later she broke her first heel – of her mothers favorite slippers. She’s always loved picking and composing photos, colors and ultimately – clothes. She spent more time rummaging through wardrobes rather than outside of them. It was the only place she could feel home, being an explorer every single time, immersing into the world full of sequins, soft fabrics as well as vast variety of colors. As she was growing up she went through fascinating stages, different subcultures and influences, which carved her character as well as consciousness in the end.   Years spent in a catholic school in Poland, surrounded by nuns in black and white robes, opened her eyes to timelessness and classical tastes.  Colorful walls of Germany, combined with austere streets of Poland and multicultural societies consolidated Jessicas own identity and style.  Yesterday she wore colors the others will transform into in a day or two. Yet one day she opened her eyes with a thought to share her passion, and created her blog JEMERCED.  Today I’m thinking ahead, creating new determinants, remembering what’s happened, where I’m from, adding moments, transience, always with an open mind. I will be making this one, single entity, not forgetting about the seasonal variability. Are you willing to write a couple of pages of this tale?  I am young and my style is still developing. But I am always trying to wear something unique and elegant. I love to mix and match different styles! Sometimes I am chic, one day more bohemian and the another one totally rock! That's my style in which one doesn't exist any rules.          As I wroty in my story I’m thinking ahead, creating new determinants, remembering what’s happened, where I’m from, adding moments, transience, always with an open mind. I will be making this one, single entity, not forgetting about the seasonal variability. I am still young and I've got a lot of energy! I always try to give my best and I hardly ever dissapoint someone, because I am a mandatory person. Fashion is my passion and I know that it's not only about clothes and runways - it's about art, history and humans - a part of everyone on the world!    I'm a 18 years old German girl living in Poznań in Poland.
