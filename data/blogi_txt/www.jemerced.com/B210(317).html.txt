Jessy Mercedes Bonnie took such a nice picture of my outfit! Burgundy (like a wine) and this dark green (like a bottle of wine) in my opinion are the most IN colours for this fall-winter season. I couldn't find anywhere a piece in that colour so IÂ made this skirt by myself. Do you like it? What do you think about it? Which colours are your most wanted colours for the coming season?
