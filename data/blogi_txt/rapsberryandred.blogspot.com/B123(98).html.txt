I've never thought this article would get so huge response! Thank you so much! (I'm blushing, blushing) Anyways...today's outfit is all about black. I definitely love this colour- the same thing can look soft-strong, modern-vintage in the same time. What can I say more...vagabond shoes again!( one day I'll find another pair of beautiful wedges :)) Kolor, który mogłabym wybrać na całe życie? Ubrania-czerń. Wszystko inne-biel. wearing second-hand top, second-hand blazer, my grandma's old bag, vagabond shoes, new yorker chains (bluzka- second-hand, marynarka- second-hand,torebka po babci, buty-vagabond, łańcuszki-new yorker)
