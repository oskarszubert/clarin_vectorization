Pink Lenin at English Яussia   Dear PINK's    I am back to My Motherland :) For the next few months I will be here and there but mostly in Warsaw. The arrival was intense: Warsaw-Poznań -Wrocław all in four days. Right now as a part of 6th Poznań Photo Biennale an exhibition curated by Iza Kowalczyk: "Charms of Power" opened in Arsenal Gallery - I have a pretty pink triptych there: three Pussy Mandalas - two of them elaborated especially for this show. I am particularly glad of being presented together with Zofia Kulik - artist that I admire very much and whose cold and perfect BW collages (that dialogue with manipulation of beauty by power structures to describe them briefly) make perfect counterpoint for my explicit and juicy pussy flowers. The show is on until June 7th - full info here. Soon I am going to Kiev where I will have a lecture about collections accompanied by slide show (over 500 images selected from my "Cult Objects" magazine presentations. This trip has for me special meaning - a part of perfect occasion to fulfill my sentimental and anthropological urges related to former USSR :) It is my first time to go to "proper Ukraine" - before I had the opportunity to know only it's southern part (Odessa, Crimea) beautiful indeed but pretty much "russificated" until now. On that occasion I would like to show funny case of pink resistance: a Lenin monument infected with pink pox - something of peculiar actuality for me as I just escaped from Mexican Vermin. Big thanks to Marcin Miałkowski for all the pink links :)     PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    check also:   Pink Tank by David Cerny in PINK TANKS post  Pink Lenin in PINK OCTOBER post
