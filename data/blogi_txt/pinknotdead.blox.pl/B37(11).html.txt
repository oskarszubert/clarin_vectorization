April Flores   courtesy of Coop666   Dear PINK's    Today once again BBW Pink: Nasty but Nice April Flores aka Fatty Delicious - Lovely Lady indeed :) The photo by Coop - L.A. based "artist, huckster, and almost a photographer": shamelessly californian, naughty-spirited, slightly arrogant but definitely talented, generous (you can freely download his photos in very high resolution) - someone doubtlessly soaked in pop culture up to the top of his head... there is many things you can tell about him but for me probably the most important is that rich conscious hedonism that emanates even from his wildest shots. One can sense that the people play and have fun here and that feels right   cool :) I came over his work for the first time searching for library nudes - subject obviously very dear to me, later I started exploring more of his work and often find myself surprised and amused by his ideas. Check his approach to the idea of Pink Riders, explore his stream on your own - there is plenty of Pleasure, plenty of Pink, plenty of Pop, really plenty of Everything there :)    As for this specific photo - I am posting it here for many reasons: the girl is really pretty and you do not need to have BBW fetish to recognize it, her sexual energy is great, the whole photo radiates pink and finally the stripy dildo she points to the gates of paradise is Candy Bar by California Exotic Novelties - one of my first vibrators, basic one, shown at PND exhibition as part of Pink Landscape :D PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    Art of Coop  Coop Shop
