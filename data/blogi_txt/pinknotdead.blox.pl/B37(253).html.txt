Inflation in zentai suit ! by funkyfeetuk   Dear PINK's    This time pink case of inflation fetishism. Exploring fetish universe seems to be a neverending story and some forms of fetish activity probably cannot be understood properly until one gets into them. Inflation fetishism also known as expansion fetishism is pretty much tierra incognita for me - as far as I understand we can difference between two basic forms of it: inflation of the suit (as on the video) and inflation of actual body parts (belly, breasts, buttocks). The last one give me creeps but finally as two days ago I was offered healthy electroshocks by an old man on Mexico City Zocalo and I happily got my dose of volts so "to anybody according to his needs" :) I suppose the inflation fetish has its origins in fascination by feeling of fullness, the look of pregnant belly, Blowfish, Balloon? It has to do with bondage on one hand and with performance on another and it is surprisingly wide spread in Internet community. Inflation is also often related to latex fetish - I mentioned already custom suits by Pretty Pervy on this blog - anyone who did not know them is most welcome to check out they amazing creations. As for pop culture I remember in one of the Æon Flux chapters ("Reraizure" - September 12, 1995) Æon and Trevor having pressure intercourse on the platform high above the clouds - that looked convincing to me :) Finally it is curious to observe how Pink penetrates into spaces since years reserved exclusively for Black.
