Lovely Man On The Girl 8 by Okimi   Dear PINK's    Lovely Man is a tiny, slimy but very, very happy character created by Tokyo based japanese designer/illustrator Kimiaki Yaegashi. Here links to his site, flickr and the very Lovely Man set - Gulliver couldn't have better time with the Queen of Brobdingnag ;) Okimi girls are truly charming sexy cuties - although suffering from King Kong syndrome I would not mind to submerge myself in such "reverse" adventure specially that the female body is the loveliest landscape I know ;)    (^-^)      PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy     Lovely Man On The Girl 6 by Okimi  www.okimi.com Okimi Flickr  Lovely Man - Set on Flickr
