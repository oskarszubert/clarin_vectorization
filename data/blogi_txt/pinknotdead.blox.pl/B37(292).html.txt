The earth is round, all the heavenly bodies are round; they all move on round or elliptical orbits. This same image of circular globe-shaped mini worlds orbiting around each other follows us right down to the microcosmos. We are even aroused by round forms in species propagation related eroticism. Why should I join the straying mass who want to make everything angular? I am going to pursue Galileo Galilei's philosophy: my world is also round.    Pink Sport Car C 112, Luigi Colani, 1970    Dear PINK's     I never was a big fan of automobilism. The only vehicle I was ever really hot for is Lancia Stratos Zero designed by Marcello Gandini  (responsible also for beautiful 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo). Today I saw for the first time Luigi Colani's design for the pink aerodynamic race car – !WooOooW! – It seams like 1970 was the year (check also Ferrari Modulo). As far as I can understand it never been produced. Luigi Colani a german born swiss italian is  a man who can be considered an eco-design guru, as already back in the 1960s, he was already campaigning for saving energy, reducing consumption and using alternative energy resources. Until now I knew only his famous Rotor House but I am keen to see and learn more about his designs and concepts. Chapeau bas Signore Colani.
