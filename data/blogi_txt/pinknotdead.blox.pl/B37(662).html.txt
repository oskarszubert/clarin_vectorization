Jack Lemmon in The Best Cake Fight Ever - The Great Race by Blake Edwards, 1965    Dear PINK's    Cake Faith is always fun specially if arranged by Blake Edwards :D Although Pink Panther was a big thing in Europe I have impression that his comedies never reach here, in the old world, the fame they deserve, possibly because of strong competition of french comedy geniuses like Luis de Funes :) Anyway, I had really hard weekend and The Big Blake again saved my Life. His sense of humor is simple but great, aesthetics are perfectly exaggerated, characters are funny and the whole thing has a lot of charm - something pretty much lost in the contemporary comedy. Henry Mancini needs no recommendation I guess. For those who know only Pink Panther series I would strongly recommend The Party (Peter Sellers at his Peak) and The Great Race - both movies are the finest of slapstick comedy genre - true Crème de la Crème :D    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    PS: Besides everything else Natalie Wood with or without Pink Outfit is simply Delicious to contemplate ❤ Natalie Wood in the Cake Fight  - The Great Race by Blake Edwards, 1965
