Hreinn Fridfinnsson Floor Piece 1992-07 Fluorescent paper, bookbinding material, cardboard box.   Collection of Pétur Arason and Ragna Róbertsdóttir. All rights reserved Hreinn Friðfinnsson 2007     Dear PINK's    Pink inside - Simple / Sensitive - makes me think about hidden luxury: the black priest robe with purple silk underneath, maoist uniform with fur inside, the new mercedes engine installed in old soviet car that father of my friend Anka used to have in early 80's... - the list is long, the piece is nice. Big Pink Smiley for Mr. Fridfinnsson and  big thanks to Hector Belloc for this pink tip :)   Hreinn Fridfinnsson is one of Iceland’s leading conceptual artists. His work is celebrated for its lyricism and stark poetry that transcends the often-commonplace subjects and materials that the artist uses to create his pieces. Although there is a consistency of theme and a common emotional thread to his art, the media that Fridfinnsson employs are remarkably varied in scale and substance, from photography, drawings and tracings to presentations and installations of sound, texts and ready-mades.
