Aurora borealis in Alaska   Dear PINK's     My heart flow north, I am attracted to the pole, missing the White Nights… again I don't know If I can drop to Sankt Petersburg this June but I would try – once you tested them you become addict - the bitter- sweet longing remains at the bottom of your soul – endless day is like a bite of endless life :)    I never seen northern lights but I am already longing for them. Seams like solar winds are at they peak around equinox so this isn't exacty the best moment to write about auroras but it happened that right now I am sunken deeply into the Pullman's Trilogy and my head is full of them. Please enjoy one of the shinny fragments from this obscure book:   The sight filled the northern sky; the immensity of it was scarcely conceivable. As if from Heaven itself, great curtains of delicate light hung and trembled. Pale green and rose-pink, and as transparent as the most fragile fabric, and at the bottom edge a profound and fiery crimson like the fires of Hell, they swung and shimmered loosely with more grace than the most skillful dancer. Lyra thought she could even hear them: a vast distant whispering swish. She was moved by it: it was so beautiful it was almost holy; she felt tears splintered the light even further into prismatic rainbows. […] And as she gazed, the image of a city seemed to form itself behind the veils and streams of translucent color: towers and domes, honey- colored temples and colonnades, broad boulevards and sunlit parkland. Looking at it gave her a sense of vertigo, as if she were looking not up but down, and across a gulf so wide that nothing could ever pass over it. It was a whole universe away. I am mesmerized by this man - I am finishing "His Dark Materials" right now - this is the best fantasy I've read since ages and the best fantasy written ever I would dare to say. Big thanks to AB for introducing me to Pullman's Univerese :) PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    check also:   Aurora Forecast
