The bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin' / That's what I said / The looser the waistband, the deeper the quicksand / Or so I have read...    春川ナミオ #001   Dear PINK's    Namio Harukawa (born 1947 in Osaka) without doubt can be seen as a cult figure at the worldwide femdom scene. I would not hesitate to say that he is a true facesitting fantasy king. Although BBW neither BDSM aren't exactly my thing I must to admit that I find many of Harukawa's divas absolutely irresistible – there's peculiar powerful sweetness in their fractions / expression and that’s why they can't be missed at the pink forum. Plenty of Harukawa's drawings, most of it either bicolor or monochrome, can be seen at adultscards.net   bbwfacehumpers.com. Master's work a part of facesitting and smothering involves also urolagnia   scatology – watch it at Ur own risk.

PS: I find curious certain parallels between Harukawa's and Żechowski's art :)      Stefan Żechowski's illustration for Emil Zegadłowicz's "Motory" 1937/8 (A year later the edition was confiscated and the artist accused of inmorality.)
