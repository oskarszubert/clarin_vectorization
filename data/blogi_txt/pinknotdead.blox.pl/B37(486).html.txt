Pink Punk at my Flicker site   Dear PINK's    Less spectacular than this one still symptomatic for modern times :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    PS: I can't belive the hypocrisy of Flickr community - I was censored again by this morons and now around 20% of the the images on my site are set to the high level of restriction although I do not consider any of them offensive. I am just bored of being flag as inappropriate for public and I definitely don't want my account to be "terminated by Flickr staff". You can see any if you wish but to be able to do it you must have your own flicker account (at least it's free) and turn The Safe Search Off.   Nazi Flickr Police Punks Fuck Off!
