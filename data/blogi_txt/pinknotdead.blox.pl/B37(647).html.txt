Sauki at SuicideGirls Flickr Stream   Dear PINK's    Although I do not heave much time to wander around at the moment it is unavoidable to not face the phenomena of Suicide Girls once you are in California. Pretty tattooed and pierced chicks are everywhere: shop attendants, bar tenders - from bakery to nightclub you are followed by they ferocious smiles. As I been invited about a year ago to join they official flicker site (I do not have much to submit there as they are not so present in my Mexican / Polish everyday life, neither are they my main female fantasy) I am fallowing with pleasure this neo-retro hard-vanilla fantasy - pretty many of the pictures involve presence of pink - phenomena of assimilation similar to the psycho pop Mexican cultures (well as we all already know pink is the new black :) Here couple of photos - please enjoy. For more information check Wikipedia article and  SG Official Site. For those especially interested I can add that there is couple of movies and books related to the subject.    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy      Pink SG - I am pretty sure that this is gricelodeon's picture but somehow I can't find it on her Flickr Stream (If I am wrong please add proper credit to it) Anyway check her Pink Life!!! and Suicide Girls Sets :)     Ceci SG at gricelodeon Flickr Stream
