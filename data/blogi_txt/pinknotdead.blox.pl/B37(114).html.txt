Inflatable Doll Boobs big photo at my flickr stream   Dear PINK's    As I wrote already before I really don't like inflatable dolls - I find them indignantly grotesque - if it will be up to me I would like to eliminate them completely (together with most of sex jokes) from the store. Still I must to admit that this particular one (anime alike character) although of very rough face distinguish itself strongly from regular stock and that not only because of its mesmerizing fluorescent body; what I found most astonishing is that the creators provided it wit some interior organs: inflatable heart and ovaries.
