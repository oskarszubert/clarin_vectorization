WOMEN TATTOO 1978 001 at my Flickr   Dear PINK's    I meet Mr. Marian at "Olimpia" - my favorite flea market. He noticed that I was talking to another guy about his tattoos and proposed that he can show me what he's got. He is probably the most impressive Illustrated Men I meet until now. In my exploration I am searching for very basic, root drawings, images that can be defined as "naive" or "primitive art". M's case does not fit here - his tattoos are extremely well done. (Probably by his brother - who I had brief occasion to talk with and who also has long - longer than half of his life -prison story.) Anyway I was totally hypnotised. M's tattoos are all women except for double portrait of Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta on his back. Many faces are anonymous for me but no doubt that he wears Pola Raksa* portrait on his inner right arm. I do not want to try to go with my interpretations too far. I never ask for the crimes committed by the people I photograph and he doesn't told me much about his drawings. Mainly technical stuff. His story with tattoos started at Czarne - prison for notorious criminals. He spend 23 years in the jail and now awaits next sentence. Considering that writing on his lower back states: WOMAN - A TOY FOR THE BED one can talk about strong mixture of worship and objectualization of women here. I am not sure if women are angels or demons for Marian - surely they are the central axis of his life.
