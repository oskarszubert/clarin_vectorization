The other one: chica sexy perreando hot con faldita a colores does not possess same joyful strength but called my attention primarily because of stripped dress and simple frame - I would like to experiment myself with such "abstract" aspect of perreo :) I will :)    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy   Meneo Papi   Direction, Pixel Art, Animation and Compositing by Entter 2009  Plot and Music by Rigo Pex  Audio Mixed by Sodamnloud / Mastered by DJA - Mad Decent Studios maddecent.com    Pixel Art Guest Artists:  typography assistance and duracell battery design by Ui iloveui.com  flickering background by Ralp myspace.com/ralp8bit    Guest singer:  french rap by Set sakrecoer.com    *MENEO is visuals by Entter and music by Rigo Pex  myspace.com/meneo
