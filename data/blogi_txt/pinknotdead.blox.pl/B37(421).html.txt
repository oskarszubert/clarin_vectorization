great Vase Metallica rose! at Le Garage Pierre Blanc   Dear PINK's    I find the act of mixing theoretically inadequate elements (natural and artificial, sex and science and so on) pretty tempting and I believe that even if new value isn't appearing clearly and immediately it is always a refreshing exercise.  Pierre le Blanc Site is a very good sample of such dynamic: the clever Frenchmen (?) is applying very simple trick (quite popular about a year ago as t-shirt fashion style) that consist in overprinting stylish ceramics (vases and plates) with simple and often brutal elements (Guns, Metal Band Logos etc.) the final effect is surprisingly good (sometimes even stunning I would say) and that is how truly post-modernistic, post- conceptual craft is born with all the contemporary nonchalance and without pain :) I strongly recommend a vista to Porcelain Tuning – whole lot of treasures awaits you there :)    As I always try to point my sources I must to admit that I came to Porcelain Tuning trough polish "cirkkkus" blog - site a bit from Mundo Rarito family that reminded me Jacopetti's Mondo Cane and awaked at least mixed feelings in my head: from one hand I am hunter and connoisseur of bizarreness and there is pretty many interesting things hooked there from another "raw" freak show seams far too simple as a key to the world/human/culture. I understand the rebel dynamic behind it, still blind hunt for hardcore oddities seams naïve, pointless and finally destructive. Obscenity is a very interesting and efficient vehicle just let's use it wise.    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy Pierre Le Blanc at My Space
