Pink Groom, 2008 by Locaburg (Mark Alor Powell)    Dear PINK's From 25th to 28th I was planning to go to Veracruz for a cousin wedding but I didn't - the bloody flu kept me in the bed :( I must to admit that I like Veracruz pretty much - the beaches maybe arent't the greatest in Mexico but general vibe is: the weather is gentle, the people are nice - elegant man and slim woman, tropical flowers, good coffee, night dancing on the plazas, soon The Great Carnival... how one can ask for more specially a pour European devil like me that keeps the nasty echo of gray polish winter under his skull. So, yeah, I was counting on some pink this days but It didn't happened - well I have enough of my internal pinkness and here comes a small sample of Veracruzean Wedding Pink seen trough Mark Powell's sharp eye: The Pink Groom from the beach weeding (the igloo like setting is the hotel room - I was about to go exactly there) - check him out and ask yourself how The Pink suits you for this New Years Eve :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
