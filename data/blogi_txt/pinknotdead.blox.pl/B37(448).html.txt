I want to surprise people, make them happy, and if possible, even completely enchant the minds of those who see my work.Â  To realize that, I will choose whatever method it takes, and will not limit myself.    Snake Bath by Toshio Saeki   Dear PINK's Yesterday I had for dinner octopus in wine   honey. The beast had tentacles size of wiener sausages. Watching my beautiful sister in law washing the monstrous corpse for several times to remove all the slime inevitably directed my mind towards particular role that this very creature plays in japanese erotic fantasies. This time I wouldn't like to stop at pretty well known tentacle rape hentai, nor at highly disturbing japanese bestiality porn (that involves use of living animals such as octopuses, eels, frogs etc.) neither I will go deep tracing its origins to famous Hokusai woodcut. Instead of that I would like to point at Toshio Saeki's extraordinary erotic pandemonium. Although I never saw any of his images executed fully in pink hues, most, if not all, of his art easily fits under "pink perversion" tag. Having that in mind I decided that such unique and infamous artist cannot be omitted at PND! Blog. Below links to several sites featuring his work.
