Convent Camaldolese / DTP Wigry, Wigry, June 2009    Dear PINK's Last three weeks I've bee living in the Monastery. It was Pink :) Documentation of The Pearl Project at my Flicker. I am pretty happy about the whole Pearl Story at many levels: becouse of the rich collaboration and participation of the people, adventure, culture at the end of the world, seduction game, tropical contrabanda, "Pleasure Culture" manifestation that fits in the catholic frame. Becouse of The Pearl Itself :) Big Thanks to Agnieszka "Gunia" Tarasiuk whose interest and faith made this project possible :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy   Per≈Ça w Perle at vlep[v]net
