Hello Pussy, Lithography  (detail) - Wojciech Tubaja, 2009 Dear PINK's    I just got it in trough pink mail. The author - Wojtek Tubaja studies etching in Posen's Fine Art Academy. The piece was done at prof. Ficner workshop and will be shown soon at Lodz Comic Fair. Pretty Pink in many senses but as for me more than whole Hello Kitty reference I love the idea of Pussy Print :) Pressing the hot puss against cold tombstone (those who did classical lithography will understand me well) and melting it. C'mon that's Pure Witchcraft. Pussy Magic. The Pink Magic :) OK, I know that probably very contrasted photograph was used here... still I am glad where it took my imagination :) Plaster Caster Girls, Yves Klein going porn... Lipstick prints are the sweetest signatures and dedications. Pussy print sounds even more intimate. I hope to receive such love letter someday :) PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy     Hello Pussy, Lithography, 120x70 cm - Wojciech Tubaja, 2009    Check also:   VAGINETTES  PINK SERIGRAPHY  EXQUISITE WET PINK  BRUTAL PINK TRUTH  PUSSY MANDALA #2  HELLO KITTY PINK RIFLE  HELLO KITTY PINK GUITAR  HELLO KITTY PINK HELL
