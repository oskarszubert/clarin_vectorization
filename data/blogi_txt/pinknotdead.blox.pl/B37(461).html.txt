Strach ma wielkie oczy.    MG Phantom; Lublin Castle, 2011 Dear PINK's     This time I would like to presume my recent pink ghost invocation: Phantom - installation over the facade of Lublin Castle. Soon after I was invited to work in Lublin I knew I want to do some light   jolly project there. Maybe because I went there in late November when the world goes into mourning, possibly because the shadow of Majdanek remains deep in my head. The history of the very castle is neither pink: it served as a prison for 123 years (1831 - 1954) - gallons of blood   tears were flushing its cobblestones. Yet there is something inevitably funny and grotesque in its anthropomorphic facade. Although the Italian architects are responsible for its design I sense some Mauritanian influence here. My work often consists in focusing points of attention. This piece can be considerate almost a ready-made. There was the face it had beige eyes and they were just asking for light. They are the mirrors of the soul, as we all know. So I decided to wake up the giant. Owl, demon - U name it. I could make it blue or green but I went pink for obvious reasons. I believe it proved pretty efficient. I'm happy, the first stage of my Tour de Pologne is concluded - soon the next moves :)   Fantom / Phantom  Maurycy Gomulicki installation at the Lublin Castle facade. 48 pink fluorescent tubes.
