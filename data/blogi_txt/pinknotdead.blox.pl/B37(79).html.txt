Full Pink Wool #0457 by Poloneker   Dear PINK's    After last dive into angora pinkness I would like now to introduce you into the more serious and hermetic circles of wool fetishism. As the cold increase that feels proper and promising. Wool fetish is something very exclusive - the community is rather small but extremely devoted. I believe I can understand a little bit the felling behind - to my imagination it speaks as a bondage cocoon, but warmest, coziest than usual BDSM gear - limitation of movement but the security of the womb at the same time. Anyway I may be wrong in my interpretation but that doesn't change the fact that the very wool idols are mesmerizing. Something from outer space, bit of theatre, bit of performance and sculpture here - don't be afraid - explore The Tight   Cozy Wool Universe :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy     Full Pink Wool #0461 by Poloneker   Below some links to my favorite wool performers:   Red Wollie  Poloneker  Oompah   My favorite pics: Pink:   Pink   Black by Redwoolie  Pink, White   Beige (The Monk) by Poloneker  Two Layers of PInk Wool by Oompah   The Rest of Rainbow:   Blue by Redwollie  Yellow   Gray by Redwollie Woolly home help 1 by Oompah  Oompah's Wool Art   Wool Fetish Providers:   www.fetishwool.net  www.fetishknits.com   Check Also:   PINK BLINDFOLDED
