didrichsen's pond, 2001 by Key McKendree   Dear PINK's   Pink Cells, Pink Balls, Pink Virus, Spreading Pink, Pink Disease - this is exactly what buzzes in my head right now - I got Chickenpox :( - no so nice Cadeau for the Birthday (I belive my neighbours from Mexico DF are behind it but there is also another thread in Tijuana) - but well not much to talk about. There is a lot of pink spots all over my body, the medicnie I am using to soften the burning sensation is also pink but the whole situation stinks and is pretty black :( On top of that if there is an epidemic of chickenpox in Tijuana Go Go Clubs in a couple of weeks that can be partly my fault... and I hate the idea of all this beautiful bodies covered with spots... Anyway  what can I do? No pink news for next few days - I am going cloistered into my personal hellhole. By the mean time enjoy the pink works of Key McKendree :) (the first one involves 28.000 balls - makes me feel like a puppy with my 150 Pink Viruses :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy     cook brook , 2001 by Key McKendree
