Untitled Pink by Ignace Wouters   Dear PINK's     Curious distortion performed on some "classic" painting by belgian artist Ignace Wouters. As he chooses not to comment on it I will take it as one more manifestation of Pink Oyster Cult because in abstraction one see what one has in his mind :) I don't know what Watteau or Fragonard would think about it but I like it :) PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
