picture found and lost at flickr.com - (if anyone knows credits for this one I am happy to post them)     Dear PINK's    That photo reminded me Oscar spitting on "dry soda" pulled over girl's body - situation loaded with very subtle mixture of innocence and perversion - anyone who do not know what I am talking about is most welcome to read (or too see) The Tin Drum by Gunter Grass.    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
