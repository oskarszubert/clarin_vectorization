Love Magic (Лювовная Магия) by Elvira Samofalova (Ельвира Самофалова)    Dear PINK's    I am back. We had great time in Kiev - a bit less public that I would expect and liked on our conference but still a complete experience - we did, we explore, we delighted ourselves a lot. The acacias are in full bloom - cascades of sweetness were falling over our heads, we drink hectoliters of cognac and walked miles and miles with our hungry eyes wide open. Monumental architecture and endless legs of Ukrainian girls persecuted us constantly. Summer sun, miniskirts, flowers softened the post communist urban decadence. I am particularly in debt with Katja who a part of pleasant conversations and fantasy boosters offered us beautiful walk up the hill to a forgotten Tatar graveyard that become a flirting site now. Wet kisses over my grave that is something I wouldn't mind at all :) Actually it could probably bring me back to life. As to be expected we visited many markets but I wasn't hunting for pink specially - still couple of pink treasures felled into my claws: a fluo pink skirt for my cute little niece Zoe and a pair of tight pink panties perfect for my girlfriends sweet round butt :) Bookinist stands at Petrivka were a very nice site for a bibliophiliac - several pop-camasutra and other alike books flashed in front of my eyes - the one above was my definitive favorite ;)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
