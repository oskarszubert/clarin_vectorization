Паровозик из Ромашкова / Steam Train from Romashkovo dir. Владимир Дегтярёв / Vladimir Dyegtyariev, Союзмультфильм / Soyuzmultfilm, 1967 at YouTube   Dear PINK's    I went over those cute pink twins few months ago but couldn't figure where they came from a part of that they are russian for sure. Right now digging in soviet animation it popped out. Паровозик из Ромашкова / Steam Train from Romashkovo. To be superquick: He is a Steam Train. He sure is Cute. He sure is Late. The whole story is extremely sensitive and wise. The three key points here are: don't miss Lilly of the Valley (ландышы) because it would be to miss The Spring itself, don't miss Nightingale (соловей) because you could be late for The Summer, stop for The Sunrise (рассвет) - each one is different in your life. If you miss it you could miss The Very Life.    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy   PS: and check them dancing :)
