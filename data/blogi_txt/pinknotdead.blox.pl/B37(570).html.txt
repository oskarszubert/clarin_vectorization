Viewmaster by Zombiebite   Dear PINK's    Pink Wham - image taken trough the View-Master viewer. First than anything viewmaster is a particularly nice device / toy / experience that belongs to this curious edge at which science show itself as magic - stereoscopy and optical illusions are simple marvels and ones of those few phenomena in front of which we often preserve children alike capacity of amazement even as wrecked adults :) From the other hand this image is specially appealing to me because since long time I am mesmerized by the process of graph- ization / icon-ization of energetic phenomena. We want to fit into shape that what is amazing but unstable like flames, explosions, the shine of the stars - the comic universe - packed as it is with supernatural conflicts between ultra powers is particularly rich in such graphic "onomatopoeia" - more on the subject in my Energy Stills statement unfortunately at the moment in spanish only) - anyway you can check images from the expo that are on my flickr.
