This time the bird's song flies directly from sunny Bulgaria but the stereotype is exactly the same as in the case of Pam Anderson or our national blond treasure Doda. There must be somewhere in the universe the Planet of Blondes where they all came from. I can easily imagine pink oceans and gigantic turquoise palm trees growing straight from pink waters - there, in the golden palaces, locked in the golden cages and guarded by ferocious chimeras with diamond teeth and ruby eyes, day by day, they wait for Prince Charming completing their monotonous but fascinating routine of blondenesness: suntan, makeup, manicure, strawberry milk baths, silicon pressure check... pink champagne flows in their veins, pink pudding in their heads, pink clouds high in the sky, pink sunset never ends there... - is that heaven or hell that depends on the personal perspective but phantoms of paradise surely they are ;)     PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy Gergana (Гергана) Kakto Predi (Както преди) at YouTube  Гергана Георгиева Кацарска (Bulgarian Wiki)  Chalga   check also: RUSOPHILIA ROSA
