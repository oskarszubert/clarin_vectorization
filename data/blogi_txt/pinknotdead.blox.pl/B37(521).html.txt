1st snake mural at My Flicker   Dear PINK's   The exhibition opens today, the murals are ready :) Their life is to be short - just one week and they are left for the darkness and mould only. Welcome to Looking Lust Terror (Zlota 1, until November 11th) Satanico Tropical    So many altars I erected already for The Wonderful Pink Oyster that it seams right time to focus on the other side of the coin. Finally it is the scepter that rules us as some king said. Basic, unavoidable dualism: desire - repulsion, temptation-fear: I would like but I am afraid - we know it all. Ferocious Form. Rampancy. Beast. Why are we more afraid of the penis than gun? Why it is easier for us to confront with cruelty than pleasure? Romance with Satanism why not? - It is part of our culture. Lucifer: Luciferian - The Light Bearer and Satanic - The Dark One. Devil. Demonization of The Sex. Sex Demon. Costerian King Spring and Spirits of The Seed in its cortège. Fertility and Rape. Procreation and Resurrection.  Spermatozoids like tiny snakes. Let it whirl - it’s Life! These time something for those who long for poisoned arrow.  Venomous Candies for Girls and Boys.     As much the subject of Agnieszka Zechowska exhibition as the chosen space ideal for this piece. Moldy Palace, lustfulness of the stuccos - here my snakes will slither around faster than at museum or shrine. They will live, they will putrefy. Pleasure from the very work itself - playing Michelangelo at the scale I can sustain. Here big thanks to the curator for provoking / making possible such situation and for my paint team for watchful and efficient work.   more images of the xpo and process at my flicker page in Satanico Tropical photo set.
