Bawi mnie czasem sprzeciwiać się jej. Natychmiast, z podbródkiem na pięści, wspiera się na łokciu w postawie wyzwania. Słyszałbyś trzepot jej rzęs. Pod jej modremi powiekami oczy widnieją jedynie błyskiem poziomym i uroczym. *    Pure Love - logotype, MG 2012    Dear PINK's     I just designed for my friend Uriel logotype for his new store. Actually I made also a proposal for the store itself including facade, and interior. This one will be focused on lingerie with just small selection of exquisite bed toys so I decided to make it more romantic – and I came up with this cameo style image that we both like.  The initial concept was to make White Erotika – I proposed a white-silver space (lots of mirrors and "capitonados") with just slight touch of pink. I also designed the silver mesh pattern for glass facade and . This is no exactly an autor's store as some rococo alike furniture has been alrady bought before but I still have a lot of fun with it. The store will be executed by Habitación 116 arquitects studio. I'm excited about it and curious what will be the final effect.    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    PS: another quote from Master Chandler that goes well with this project – just to gave U a bit of the idea towards wher I was moving this time :)             This room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead. There were full-length mirrors and crystal doodads all over the place. The ivory furniture had chromium on it, and the enormous ivory drapes lay tumbled on the white carpet a yard from the windows. The white made the ivory look dirty and the ivory made the white look bled out. The windows stared towards the darkening foothills. It was going to rain soon. There was pressure in the air already. I sat down on the edge of a deep soft chair and looked at Mrs. Regan. She was worth a stare. She was trouble. She was stretched out on a modernistic chaise- longue with her slippers off, so I stared at her legs in the sheerest silk stockings. They seemed to be arranged to stare at. They were visible to the knee and one of them well beyond. The knees were dimpled, not bony and sharp. The calves were beautiful, the ankles long and slim and with enough melodic line for a tone poem. She was tall and rangy and strong-looking. Her head was against an ivory satin cushion. Her hair was black and wiry and parted in the middle and she had the hot black eyes of the portrait in the hall. She had a good mouth and a good chin. There was a sulky droop to her lips and the lower lip was full. check also:   PINK CHARACTERS  LOVE STORE   * Ogród pieszczot anonimowe arabskie wiersze miłosne z X wieku.  na podstawie tłumaczenia Franza Toussaint  przełożył z francuskiego Leopold Staff   Towarzystwo Wydawnicze w Warszawie, 1922
