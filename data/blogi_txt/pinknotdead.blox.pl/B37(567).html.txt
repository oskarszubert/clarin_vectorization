Pink Piranha - customized GAZ Automobile Волгоград / Volgograd, 2008 - courtesy of Danner Gyde   Dear PINK's   Black Volga was a terror of my childhood... the evil black car (with white curtains in the windows  - now I like this detail) abducting children in the night... draining they blood - the perfect cure for rich Germans suffering for leukemia... Stephen King couldn't do better :) Anyway the hell is always so easy to picture out - what about the legend of Pink Volga appearing on the streets only during white nights with the cloud of pink lily scent surrounding it, driven by Beautiful Slavic Hierodules that offer Unspeakable Carnal Pleasures to the passerby? That’s the sort of rumor I go for :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy     Pink Chaika-14 GAZ automobile, Казань / Kazan, 2008 - courtesy of Danner Gyde   PS: Chaika is a perfect mobile bedroom - plenty of room, luxury finishing - highly recommended - I had occasion to verify it one summer night in mid 80's - unfortunately with drunken friend instead of cute and voluptuous daughter of the car owner :)   Czarna Wołga
