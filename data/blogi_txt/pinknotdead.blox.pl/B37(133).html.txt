Untitled Pink at Paskualito's Flickr Stream   Dear PINK's Simple and Sensitive. Like Yin   Yang just in this case both sides look equally gentle :) Pasqualito is young mexican photographer, student of Mark Alor Powell. Although many of his pictures have often visible influence of Detroit Master I find most of them convincing and he starts to surprise me now. Thanks for The Pink Man :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    Check also: PINK POWELL
