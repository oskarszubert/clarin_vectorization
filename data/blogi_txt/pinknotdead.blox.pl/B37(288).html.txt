...and more, much more than this, I did it my way!    Plastic Pink High Heels by Vivienne Westwood, 2014    Dear PINK's Madame Strikes Again – Listen to the Wonder Woman:   ♛ Fashion is very important. It is life-enhancing and, like everything that gives pleasure, it is worth doing well. ♛ My son has followed fashion since he was a punk. He and I agree that fashion is about sex. ♛ It is not possible for a man to be elegant without a touch of femininity. ♛ The only possible effect one can have on the world is through unpopular ideas. ♛ I disagree with everything I used to say. ♛   PINK NOT DEAD! check also:   PINK BLOW  LO RES PINK  PINK NIKE  PINK HEELS Bonus:   Kate Moss at Vivienne Westwood F/W show 1994   PS: Every time I have to look up a word in the dictionary, I'm delighted. ❤
