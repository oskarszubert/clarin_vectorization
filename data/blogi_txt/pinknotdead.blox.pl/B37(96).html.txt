Erigero by ChimPom   Dear PINK's    Today a guy named Miguel wrote a comment on one of the pink pictures at my flicker: Once when I was at a carnival I saw this beautiful girl dressed all in vivid pink clothes. I watched her, mesmerized, as she got onto a ferris wheel with her friends. I waited on the ground watching as she went around and around on the tall loop of the ferris wheel. When she got off of the ride she threw up PINK vomit all over the place. Later that night I asked her friends if she was OK. They said she had eaten too much cotton candy and red licorice. I'll never forget seeing a girl dressed in pink and throwing up pink. It was surreal.   It remind me that some time ago I found over the web a video called Erigero by ChimPom (a group of Japanese artists) with pretty girl in pink mini skirt vomiting pink - I wanted to buy it but I never manage to contact them and the page is in Japanese :(    PINK NOT DEAD!
