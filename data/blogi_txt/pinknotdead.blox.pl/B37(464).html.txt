Baby experience 童女經驗   (fragment) by Jovixu 許仙人   Dear PINK's Pixel art as any aesthetic phenomena that appears in direct relation to technology is pretty much abandoning the main stream by now and finding itself in specific niche for fans. After its immense popularity and fantastic success of Eboy it is very rare now, in the 64 bit decade to find something fresh coming from the digital mosaic universe.  Jovixu is a pixel designer from China. I was immediately enchanted with the few little drawings of her that I could see on flicker. I am happy to find someone who explores pleasure and perversion with such visual culture - fine lady of the pixel she is! Here two samples of pinkworks: above Shibari below Medical Fetish.
