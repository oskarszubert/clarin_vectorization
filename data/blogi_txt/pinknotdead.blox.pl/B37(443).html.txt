Pink October   in PND! Set at My flicker   Dear PINK's    So we have October again - let it be Pink - the Lenin from above seams to be specially done for the occasion and as I am reading extended Stalin biographies* right now It was difficult to avoid the basic pink conversion posted below. I was trying to distillate some pink bits from Stalin Story but its really hard - he sleep under pink duvet on one of his exiles, he seduced thirteen years old girl in Siberia and had a child with her, he used to play forbidden games with his second wife - he was taking her to quiet street in Petersburg and offered her fruits when eating outside was considered improper behavior... and finally we have the whole enthusiasm of building New Better World of course - just this millions of executed people, famine in Ukraine, NKVD torturers, Gulags and so cast some sort of uncomfortable dirty shadow here....    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy "Stalin Receiving May 1st defiliade at Pink Square"    For those interested into digging deeper in the background of Bolshevik Revolution I can recommend following books:    Intelligenza di Lenin, (1936) by Curzio Malaparte   *Young Stalin and  Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar both by Simon Sebag Montefiore (wszystkie tytuły dostępne w polskim tłumaczeniu - Malaparte jedynie antykwarycznie)    PS: I am flying to Warsaw today so my blog activities will be mostly suspended during next month or so. October the 9th at 6 PM opening of Pożądanie – Patrzenie – Przerażenie / Lust – Looking – Terror exhibition, Warsaw, ul. Złota 1 - I hope I will manage to have my Tropical Satanic Lust details ready by then... - Welcome :)
