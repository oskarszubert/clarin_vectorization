Dear PINK's    To było już na wystawie, w książce, ale myśle że powinno znaleźć sie też w blogu: pamiętny przypadek Pink-Manii wyczytany w "Psychopatii Sexualis" von Krafft-Ebinga. ////// Esto estaba en el book en la expo pero creo que merece estar en el blog también: memorable caso de Pink-Manía encontrado en "Psychopatia Sexualis" de von Krafft-Ebing.  ////// This was already present in the book displayed on the exhibition but I believe its worth to mention on the blog: memorable case of Pink - Mania found in von Krafft-Ebing's "Psychopatia Sexualis". Case 123.   B., thirty years of age, apparently untainted, refined and sensative; great lover of flowers; liked to kiss them, but without any sensual motive or sensual excitement; rather of frigid nature; did not before twenty-one practice onanism, and subsequently only at periods. When twenty-one he was introduced to a young lady who wore some large roses on her bosom. Ever since then large roses dominated over his sexual feelings. He incessantly bought roses; kissing them would produce erection. He took them to bed with him altough he never touched his genitals with them. His pollutions henceforth were accompanied by dreams of roses. He would dream of roses of fairy like beauty and inhaling their fragrance, have ejaculation. He became secretly engaged to his "lady of roses", but the platonic relation grew colder, and when the engagement was broken off the rose-fetishism suddenly and permanently disappeared. It never returned, even when he became again engaged after a long spell of melancholia.  (A. Moll, Centralb. f. d. Krankheiten der Harn- und Sexualorgane, v, 3).   PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
