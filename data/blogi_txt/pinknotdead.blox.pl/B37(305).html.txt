The tones of gray, pale turquoise and pink will prevail. Jessica Stam in Pink for Christian Dior Fall / Winter 2007 Dear PINK's     Today Top Shelf Pink. It's Beautiful. Instead of commenting a quote from my beloved Black Bishop:   She was quite a doll. She wore a white belted raincoat, no hat, a well- cherished head of platinum hair, booties to match the raincoat, a folding plastic umbrella, a pair of blue-gray eyes that looked at me as if I had said a dirty word. I helped her off with her raincoat. She smelled very nice. She had a pair of legs-so far as I could determine-that were not painful to look at. She wore night sheer stockings. I stared at them rather intently, especially when she crossed her legs and held out a cigarette to be lighted.  "Christian Dior," she said, reading my rather open mind. "I never wear anything else. A light, please."  "You're wearing a lot more today," I said, snapping a lighter for her. "I don't greatly care for passes this early in the morning." "What time would suit you, Miss Vermilyea?" *    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy     * Raymond Chandler "Playback" 1958     check also: Pink Dior photo #2  Pink Dior photo #3  Jessica Stam by Richard Burbridge, i-D September 2004
