Татуировки заключенных, Limbus Press, St. Petersburg, 2006  [pic. no. 736; page. 150]    Dear PINK's Lately (thanks to Konrad) I came across of pretty impressive and controversial Russian book called "Tatuirovki Zakliuchennykh" ("Prisoners Tattoos") a collection of over 700 tattoos registered in Russian gulags, correctional institutions, morgues etc. between 1948 - 2000, by MVD major Danzig Baldaev. Most of them express hatred (towards System, Jews, Women etc.) so consider it adult stuff. Still they iconic potential is extremely strong and the whole experience worth taken.
