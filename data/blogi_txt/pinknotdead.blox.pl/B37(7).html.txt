Dear PINK's    As I was lately reading Norman Mailer's "The Castle in the Forest" - fascinating and freighting fiction based on Adolf Hitler's childhood (The book, written from devil's point of view gives us a terrible insight into the process of the crystallization of Evil. Blood-scandal is a key point in the story) I came across the following fragment that fits well on this blog, especially after Walter's declaration on the very same matter.   If, at present, the horse came first, soon it would be all about girls. The father knew this as well as if sperm were stirring in his own good equipment. Those revelations! Nothing could be better than the moment when a woman opened her legs for you. That first time! If you had an eye for little differences, you knew twice as much about her as you could learn from her face. Alois Senior would attest to that. The female organ! Whoever designed this form had certainly been sly about the job. (This was about as close as Alois ever came to admiring the Creator.) Such a wonderful array of meats and juices - such a panoply of flesh in miniature - this offering of archways and caverns and lips. Alois was certainly no philosopher, so he not have known how to speak of Becoming (that state of existence when Being suddenly feels itself out in the open), but all the same, he could have given a tip to Heidegger. Becoming is, yes, exactly when a woman opens her legs! Alois felt like a poet. How not? These were poetic thoughts.
