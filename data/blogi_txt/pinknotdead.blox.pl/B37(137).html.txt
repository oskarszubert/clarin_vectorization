Alex Székely Dreaming Man on the Bench, 1961  41,5x29 cm, pencil on paper    Dear PINK's     I just discovered Alex Székely and it was a love from the first sight. Pretty pornographic, often orgiastic, yet naive in some sense; ludic, lascivious and truly cute - that's the kind of erotic art I definitely like :) His erotic scenes are build in a manner of pornographic sequences, from five up to 15 images. The style varies slightly but most of the time it oscillates between simple drawing and a mix of it with aquarelle. One can find some "classic" themes, musical, party and park scenes but mostly just "bed time stories". His humorous drawings are the ones I like the least. I could not find much background info about the man - the only thing that seems sure is the date of his birth: 1901 - I appreciate link to any data sources is someone was more lucky than me. Plenty of his drawings can be found at Kiesselbach Gallery   Auction House Site. I would love to acquire some to my collection but as far as I can see they are a bit to expensive for me :}    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy     Alex Székely Erotic Scene by the Water (1/6), 1955  32x21,2 cm, red chalk on paper     Alex Székely Erotic Scene by the Water (2/6), 1955  32x21,2 cm, red chalk on paper     Alex Székely Erotic Scene (1/5), 1942  21x15,4 cm, mixed technique on paper     Alex Székely Erotic Scene (2/5), 1942  21x15,4 cm, mixed technique on paper     Alex Székely Házibuli - un bal chez elles (1/15), 1962  43,3x30,6 cm, mixed technique on paper     Alex Székely Házibuli - un bal chez elles (2/15), 1962  43,3x30,6 cm, mixed technique on paper      check also:    PINK PIGALLE
