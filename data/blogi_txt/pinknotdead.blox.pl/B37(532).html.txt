Dear PINK's    Still focusing on Pink Papers - for quite long time I abandoned the category of Banal Conversions - Here is the next one. Although this time it is a spontaneous appearance: magenta proof for the small cinema poster that filtered into collectors recycling process. This sort of print mistakes we can see as recognized value in the disappearing world of post stamps. (The other sample would be the phenomena of collecting sun-faded prints) Considering that we are in Mexico I will be not surprised if they went into regular circulation. Gift from my dear friend Jeronimo who is opening today ABCDF presentation in Kordegada Gallery in Warsaw. As for psychedelic aesthetics of Yellow Submarine an interesting clone is a soviet animation titled "Mystery of the Third Planet" based on the Kir Bylychev's* novel (Travels of Alice (1974) first from Alice* series) - his writings are a pretty Pink Case in Soviet SF.
