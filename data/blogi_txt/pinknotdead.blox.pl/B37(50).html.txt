When someone is completely enclosed in pink fuzzy fur, they have no race, age or gender.    Bunny Boy, Nick Cave, 2009 [photo by James Prinz]    Dear PINK's     I saw this creature first at Air France magazine (featured as le géant échevelé) during my last flight to Mexico. It appeared there because of Lille 3000 festival*. It was one of those brief notes that tell U nothin' but point Ur attention at somethin' which finally isn't that bad. It looked sort of ghoulish and I liked it at the first sight but I was quite surprised to read that Nick Cave is the author. Nick Cave** doin’ fluffy costumes? WTF but well I remember "Paris Match" article with photographs of Sylvester Stallone paintings so finally why not. Once at the ground, my jet lag more or less controlled I found out that this is completely different Nick Cave. I have no time to investigate deeper but the guy seems pretty clear with his goals and his soundsuits surely are amazing, specially in movement – it make me think of some of the creations of my favorite Spanish designer and friend Carlos Diez Diez (Collection 2008/09 – based on similar bird alike floating feather experience) but taken to a different level.    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    * and Lille will always mean Milady Winter ❤ for me.    ** Oh!
