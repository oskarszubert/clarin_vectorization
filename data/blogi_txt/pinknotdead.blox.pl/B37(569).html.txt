The Fragile On Its Cloak   by Franz West via: karimshalaby.blogspot.com (thanks Tomek)    Dear PINK's    Franz West's Pink Piece exhibited at last Venice Biennale. I do not have much to say: I do not know Franz West work very much, I am not following Venice Biennale, I do not understand what artist meant by the title? I am even not sure about technique, size etc. I just like because it is rich in pink, becouse it is glossy   slippery, becouse it is a Pink Hole :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
