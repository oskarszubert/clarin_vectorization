Que dichosas son las pulgas / Que se suben a tu cama /  A gozar de tu hermosura / De la noche a la mañana    Pink Cricket photo: Lisa Presley, thanks Krzysiek    Dear PINK's     Seems that there is more pink bugs than one could think. Even pink grasshoppers although those are pretty rare. With ratio 1 : 1000, pink grasshopper became an extremely rare to found on earth. First discovered in 1887, this pink color is the result of a condition called erythrism, similar to a recessive gene that afflicts albino animals. Professor Dan Johnson, former President of the Entomological Society of Canada wrote about this: ”.. The rose form of some grasshoppers appears to be genetic. The rose colour is not restricted to one species of family of grasshoppers and katydids, but is is always rare. In some cases, the proportion of rose-coloured members of a local population may increase to as much as 10%, but typically they are rare, on the order of 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10,000, or even rarer.
