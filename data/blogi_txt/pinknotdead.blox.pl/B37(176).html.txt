Big Tits by Tabor Robak   Dear PINK's     Today couple of interesting typographic mashups by two artists/designers I catch on flicker. Tabor Robak experiments a lot with different sort of images when Takuro Utsumi is more focused on typography. Anyway they both use similar resource using typos with very determinate aesthetic related to very specific cultural genders in completely different often "inappropriate" context. Although both cases I have chosen for PND! post have already hidden "pink meaning" I took liberty to alter its color. I hope the authors will forgive me this little sacrilege :)    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy     Staurday Night by Takuro Utsumi
