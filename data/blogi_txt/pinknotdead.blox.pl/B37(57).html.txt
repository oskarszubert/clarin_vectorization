"Cream Pie" Maurycy Gomulicki, 2006 /// MG Flicker Profile Dear Pink's    "Do not call the wolf out of the forest" is a polish proverb and here it is: I get censored on Flicker! This Sunday somebody flag some of my photos as "inappropriate for public" so in effects my whole stream was set up to private. Sounds absurd considering amount of trash porn floating over Flicker but is real. The case was probably some of my photos from sex fair either one with sex scene on TV screen (more grotesque than anything else but well inappropriate I guess) either the inflatable doll... whatever - the only thing I do not understand is why to block the whole account instead of the questionable image. Also all my pictures (toys, graveyards, architecture) had been removed from the other people's favorites. It took me about 3 hours to set it back to work and after the whole thing went red again... and here is a problem: How can I know what picture is "inappropriate" (I removed three I believe could be seen as such) when I see them all pretty decent. No answer to my mails from flicker management... Anyway let's stop crying. I just classified all the possibly "morally dangerous" pictures (panties and "Cream Pie" from PND!) as visible to friends only. So if you like to see my entire stream you just need to be added to my friend list and for me to do that first you should have your age set in your flicker profile. What a mess!    Below are links to some of my teorically censored pictures. I consider that being on this blog you are over 18 years of age and know what you wish to see. From the other hand I do not have any "genital" or "frontal nudity" on my stream. Frontal Nudity! - God Save Me! - What a dangerous thing it is! :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    Maurycy
