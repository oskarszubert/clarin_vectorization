One shoe can change your life ;)    The Lo Res Pumps by United Nude, Spring / Summer 2011    Dear PINK's     It's Cindrella time again! Let me introduce pink concept shoes by United Nude. Reduced number of polygons is a pretty simple but also pretty spectacular idea. The Lo Res is part of United Nudeâ€™s digital design revolution. Computer aided design cuts the smooth rubber surface like a diamond. With a removable strap and leather foot bed, these classy and comfortable pumps will become a girl's new best friend. In 2012 collection there is transparent neon pink version of it but in this case I rather go for the bubblegum classic. True Eye Candy. Thanks Ef :)    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy    PS: talkin' about plastic dreams I like pretty much Karim Rashid design for my favorite Brazillian brand Melissa. check also:   PINK BLOW  PINK HEELS  HAPPY FEET
