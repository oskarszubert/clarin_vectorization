Girls, girls! Listen! Have I got a trunk full of dirt? ELEFANTE_ROSA, MG, 2012    Dear PINK's     Public sculpture in a children playground in one of Mexico City parks. Part of wider series of different animals. 60's I guess – we published several images of them in ABCDF – Visual Dictionary of Mexico City – I will try to check exact data on it but unfortunately I don't have copy at hand right now. Recently the whole playground at Pushkin Park was repainted and the elefant turned pink to my delight :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy    check also:   Frank Kozik's Dr. Bomb (pink version)  Waliszewska: Różowy słoń z książki Sergiusza Piaseckiego "Bogom nocy równi"
