is this really a bikini? at hiheelfriend's flickr stream   Dear PINK's    It seams that I am getting pretty unilateral lately but I believe I don't need to ask for forgiveness :) What's the cause? Well testosterone and prolactin have to do with it, besides that, when spring is at the door (here in Mexico the plum trees are in full blossom already) and one's free time is filled with lecture of victorian baudy book ( My Secret Life *) the mind can definitely set to zeros and fill up with big pulsating vulva in no time :) Anyway what I wanted to point this time is the very pinkness of The Camel Toe phenomena - something that I remember well as important counterpoint of my early teens (80's with all its tight denims were very favorable for it, today we are living rather Pro Whale Tail period of fashion) Above and Below two splendid samples of the phenomena :) Long Life The Camel!    PS: As for micro bikini - the narrow space between clothing and nakedness is a pleasurable and challenging zone - the garment that look like bondage applied on the body I find it very stimulating. As for the actual microkini it is not exactly my trip but still something worth noticing here :) PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy     Pink Camel Toe at samisarai's Panties Close Up's   * Check also: The Erotomaniac: The Secret Life of Henry Spencer Ashbee by Ian Gibson, DaCapo Press, 2001
