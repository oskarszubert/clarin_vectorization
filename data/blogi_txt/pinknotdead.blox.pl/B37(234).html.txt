Bang Bros Promo    Dear PINK's   Bang Bros is a brand already pretty established on the internet porn scene - as for the movies themselves there is no much to talk about - they do not differ radically from recent main stream northern-american productions. Still one must recognize that Bang Bros were one of the precursors in the use of exaggerate wide angle in porn. Also concidering recent phenomena the violent expansion of the photographic field due to the omipresence of digital cameras (where professional-amateur ploarization isn't anymore efficient as a description tool) and growing intrest of artists an critics in potentials hidden in this overflow of images (Adam Mazur's Antyphotogrphy exhibition in Poznań Arsenał, Mikołaj Długosz's Real Foto project, my own The Best of The Rest both recently presented at the  Red Eye Effect show in Warsaw's CCA) I would like to point BB's promotional sites with casual but visualy pretty impacting stils from they movies. This is definintely contemporary approach to porn and pretty interesting case of contemporary photography.     PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy Bang Bros Promo
