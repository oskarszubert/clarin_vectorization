Pink Bedroom at lunger girl's Flicker stream   Dear PINK's Lately I spend a lot of time in bed unfortunately not because of pleasure but pain - the black flu got me during last gray and cold Mexican hurricane days. My Bedroom is Pretty Pink (Pink Curtains, Pink Ceiling, Pink Neon Light and Pink Bed of course) still I am not yet in a shape to beat this!
