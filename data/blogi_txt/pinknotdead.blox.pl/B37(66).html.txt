Mimosa Pale by her piece Mobile Female Monument found at Umbar Flickr Stream   Dear PINK's   Mobile Female Monument by young artist Mimosa Pale awake a lot of attenion in Finland. The piece had obviously feministic background and is declared to "dialogue with fallic tradition in sculpture". As for my point of view anything erected vertically can be seen as fallic independently of cultural and social tenedncies of place and time but OK we are still living in Male Dominated Reality so I will not complain on that aspect of discourse. What bothers me more is "The Meet" aspect of the very piece that I found rather forced - for me Pussy is much more than that. Itâ€™s a Shrine.
