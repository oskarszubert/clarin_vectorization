Overnight, very   Whitely, discreetly,   Very quietly    Our toes, our noses    Take hold on the loam,    Acquire the air. Pink Mycena by Steve Axford  Nobody sees us,   Stops us, betrays us;   The small grains make room.   Soft fists insist on Heaving the needles,   The leafy bedding,   Even the paving. Our hammers, our rams,   Earless and eyeless,   Perfectly voiceless,   Widen the crannies,   Shoulder through holes. We Diet on water,   On crumbs of shadow,   Bland-mannered, asking Little or nothing.   So many of us!   So many of us!      Pink Colony by Steve Axford    Ascocoryne sarcoides by Steve Axford Lentinus sp. by Steve Axford  We are shelves, we are    Tables, we are meek,    We are edible,    Nudgers and shovers    In spite of ourselves.    Our kind multiplies:    We shall by morning    Inherit the earth.    Our foot's in the door. Sylvia Plath, 1959    check also:   AMANITA MUSCARIA  SIEROTKA OCTOBER PINK
