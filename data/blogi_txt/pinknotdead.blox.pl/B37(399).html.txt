pink room   at Hande Aksoy Flicker Stream   Dear PINK's    Since some time I am observing Pink Rooms Flickr Group - somehow I find it a bit shy but still from time to time I am falling in love - and This is The Case :) Actually a few days ago I was watching The Nutty Professor - Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy - not bad nor great either but Ladies and Gentleman: Color! Scenography! Interiors! - the end of 50's beaggining of 60's - this very moment of total color permission!!! !WoW! It never went higher in XX century. The coral mark of the mirror makes aesthetic highlight here :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy below some links to more Pink Rooms:   Milan designweek 2008_01 Milan designweek 2008_02  Pink Living Room  Pink Kitchen  Pink Powder Room  Pink Bedroom
