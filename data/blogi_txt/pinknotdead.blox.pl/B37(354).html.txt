Pink Hunchback; Jasne Lake, Warmia, Poland. Late May 2007. Photo: Domex, Big picture at my flicker page   Dear PINK's That's Me - The Horrible Hunchback. Fluorescent Pink Brief by American Apparel - I must to admit that I like this brand - they are doing pretty simple things with a lot of attention to color. Here is one more pic from the same day: me together with my beloved Sis :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    Maurycy
