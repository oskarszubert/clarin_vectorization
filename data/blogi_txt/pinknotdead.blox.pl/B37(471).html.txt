(...) obarczona lepkim pyłkiem, wchodzi do kwiatu następnego i tam rozpoczyna się na nowo dramat uczty, bójka, upadek, kąpiel i ratunek, który z konieczności doprowadza do zetknięcia pyłku z chciwemi wargami znamienia.    pollen [malva sylvestris] by  Rob Kessler   Dear PINK's    "British photographer and professor Rob Kesseler captures the exotic microscopic detailing of various flora. Merging the worlds of  art and science, Kesseler’s depictions of the natural world were initially inspired by medieval stylistic illustrations and Dutch flower paintings - slowly evolving to reveal the ornate and mesmeric structures of the various plant material he examined.  To create the eclectic visual imagery – original samples are spluttered with a fine coating of gold and then photographed on a scanning electron microscope. These images are then manipulated using subtle washes and layers of colour to amplify their forms and display the intricate anatomy of pollen, seeds, fruit and leaves with breathtaking clarity. The micrograph artwork is directed solely by nature’s mystery and peculiarity - its richness and complexity - and most palpably, its sheer beauty."   Thanks for Pink Professor Kessler!
