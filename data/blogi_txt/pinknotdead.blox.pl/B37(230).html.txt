Neon - construction project with additional supporting structure.    Dear PINK's    I am back in Mexico - seams like not for long - looks like I am going to visit Warsaw two times more this year... My head is still dizzy from the time jump so for now just few more images of my planned  Pink Neon Sculpture The things are progressing well, the Żoliborz local government response was pretty positive and we are entering permissions stage now (long and painful bureaucracy it sounds) I would like to thanks here again to Bogna, Paulina and everybody else who is helping to make it real :) The planned date of launch moved again - could be November - what is fine for me as it is the one of the grayest and saddest months in Poland so gives strong context (and contrast) for such pink manifestation. The other option is December - I would like to avoid banal, commercial optimism of Christmas period but New Year's Eve seams perfect moment to glorify Bubbles Beauty :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy Neon Kępa Potocka - simulation, day     Neon Kępa Potocka - simulation, night
