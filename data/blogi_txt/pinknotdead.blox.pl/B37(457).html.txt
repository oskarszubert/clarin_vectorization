Dr. Juan at Expo Sexo 2010   Dear PINK's     Today couple of "Pink People":  above Dr. Juan Antonio Rodriguez - sexolgist that collaborate with Erotika (and also owes one of the franchises) - wise, sensitive, handsome man that reminds me young Sean Connery and his alpha-malness in the most gentle sense of it :) Below another "Bond Girl" alike picture of a young Cuban Dancer that I meet accidentally at the beaginning of the last day of the Mex Sex Fair and who impressed me deeply with her Exceptional Beauty. Statuesque, voluptuous and innocent at once. She is a living proof of Genetic Superiority of the Black Race. I would love Her to become one of my library ghosts of pleasure - let's see how it goes. I am curious what will become of Her? Will She get stuck in adult entertainment or will She try something else? Can She reach peaks of fame or will quickly deteriorate?  The time will show... I cannot find the right words to express the impression She caused upon me but as I am reading at this very moment last novel by always so brilliant Terry Pratchett who toys now with the idea of naive "supermodel to be" I would like to quote his descrption of Juliet that fits here perfectly:   ...what she had went beyond beauty. It was a sort of distillation of beauty that travelled around with her, uncoiling itself into surrounding ether. When she walked past, wizards felt the urge to write poetry and buy flowers.   ...
