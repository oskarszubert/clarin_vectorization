Pink Monolith big photo at my flickr stream   Dear PINK's Pink Monolith - "austrian curtain" applied over. This "Kubric's alike" monolith was never touched during the existence of the museum. I decided to apply white light on it (the whole expo is illuminated with UV) for two reasons - first: if I am trying to build a bridge between high and pop I do not want full night club lighting in the museum a touch of "neutral" cold white seams right here; then most of the fluo pinks tends to have orange-ish tone in the Black Light and I wanted to preserve The Pink as much for what it means (Pink Monolith, Pink Not Dead!) as to retain certain link with rebel punk color dynamics (Never Mind the Bollocks here is the Sex Pistols)    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy    More from my "Eco Fver" Exhibition at my flickr: ECO FEVER Set
