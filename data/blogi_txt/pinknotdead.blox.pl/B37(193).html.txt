Pink Hitler fashion ad by Zerocentro (via. chan4chan.com) Dear PINK's     Today I would like to present Pink Hitler - "the scandalous ad" for New Form - Palermo's fashion boutique. "Change Style – Don't Follow Your Leader" is the slogan of the whole campaign created by local advertising agency "Zerocentro". Mao is supposed to be next in the pink row. I must admit that the idea of pink ϟϟ uniform circled inside of my head for some time (I was planning to replace black with pink, silver with gold and white with violet) so I cannot say that the whole thing is totally unattractive to me. The change from Teutonic darkness into hedonic pinkness seems like a very clean case of banal conversion and interest me as such. Transsexual details and the whole aura of perversion are only natural for such manipulation. More than offended I am mesmerized by the zeitgeist that is visible in this very case: obviousness of the exploitation of the scandal as commercial vehicle, the impotency of the cynicism, the domestication of the perversion and so on. I am only curious about Chinese reaction for the next venue - will they protest or will the dig it like a piece of cake? More detailed news can be found here: www.thefirstpost.co.uk, www.telegraph.co.uk. So much for the Sicilian Incident. Before finishing I would like to use this opportunity to point at two fascinating cases of Nazi glam I came across lately: Iron Sky movie (check teasers) and Me   you (Я и ты) video clip by Ukrainian singer Eva Braun (Ева Браун). That's All Volks!
