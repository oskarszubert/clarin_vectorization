tarapaty (trouble)   by Aleksandra Waliszewska   Dear PINK's Today I would like to point your attention on the new paintings of Aleksandra Waliszewszka. Some years ago this extremely sensitive girl let herself know to the public from "Italian" alike oils and as she have pretty much isolationist attitude on contemporary art scene probably reminds in the conscience of those who seen her previous work as "classical female painter". Waliszewska has totally different and violently fertile period in her work right now - I am stating that not because of my sympathy to this naughty girl (I know her since she was 12 y.o.) but because I am truly moved by her recent pieces. I must to admit that I was lately often hard on her accusing her of being too "Darger-ish" and not taking clear posture in reference to it but this is because when I see something that really happens, my criteria rises: the more I perceive the more I demand. At Waliszewska recent paintings you will see pretty obscure bestiarium with a lot of iconographical references to various periods of art history and only slight shadows of pink in it - more twisted sexuality and sensitive perversion than happiness in any case but definitely something worth attention. If you are interested in the invisible beat of culture and want to know more of contemporary polish painting (different than that what in spite of its unquestionable quality begins to be main stream) check her flicker site.
