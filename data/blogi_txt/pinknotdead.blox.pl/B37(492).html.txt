Queens Promo Car, photo: Wojtek Wilczyk, Parking Lot, A4 highway entering Gliwice, 2005    Dear PINK's    Once we talk with Wojtek Wilczyk about the pink "Tarpan" or alike pink car we both saw ages ago and it turned out that Wojtek, who between his many other interests registers the phenomena of old cars converted into ads (Life After Death project  ), has it his archive. A true Polish Pink it is - a bit sad - what can I say... Table Dance Clubs in Poland remain mystery for me and I am afraid I am not missing much. I may be wrong but if the quality of places / shows matches the quality our national porn productions it must be an absolute fiasco. From the other hand no doubt there must be some beautiful creatures dancing on the pole somewhere around although most of the perfect Slavic Vixens usually are heading West in its Pink Peregrination and if only can does not stop here for too long.  I am also sort of curious of polish man dynamics in such places - do they go on heavy alcohol boosted aggressive ego drive as usually or there is a bit more of common amazement that softens they behavior? Anyway the status of sex business is still pretty undefined here in Poland and I believe we have much more Basic Brothels than Sensuality Shows. The standard polish man is horny but often primitive in his approach to desire and definitely this side of life remains hidden from the society eventually presumed and exaggerated in "boys talks". I like the Sensuality Theatre very much and I hope that someday the status of sex performers and overall erotic culture will change. Somehow the phenomena of porn stars becoming international celebrities can be seen as one of first steps on this path but the way from shame to glory still remains pretty long and definitely longer and harder here in gray mist of guilt.    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy
