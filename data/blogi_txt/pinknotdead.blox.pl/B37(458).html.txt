Pink Feather by Sølve Sundsbø     Dear PINK's     Today I would like to invite you to enjoy few pink images by London based Norwegian photographer Sølve Sundsbø. I am usually not much responsive to fashion photography but he really make my day more than once. Floating hair (Hair Storm) or projections over the body (Edita Vilkevicute ) are nothing new in this universe but Sundsbø pictures stand out in the "Great Vanity Fair" not because of its originality but they truly awesome quality. They are perfect I would even say. Nobody will tell me that Beauty is Boring - Chapeau bas Master Sundsbø :)    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy     Pink Pac from Pac Attack by Sølve Sundsbø (via: touchpuppet.com)     Pink Lips by Sølve Sundsbø (via: touchpuppet.com)
