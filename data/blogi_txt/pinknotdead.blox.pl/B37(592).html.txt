PPG: Bubbles - Danger Level 11, Bubblevicious dir. Gennedy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, on air: Jan 20, 1999    Dear PINK's    Lately I went trough couple of early chapters of Powerpuff Girls. My admiration to McCracken and Tartakovsky does not diminished one inch over the years. No point event to start mentioning they aesthetical and popcultural references, the guys are smart   sensitive - they can take as much from 30's as 50's or 70's and their funny synthesis of original concept always works :)  Besides McCracken idea is truly original and brilliant and I believe time proof - how nice it would be to have all criminal issues resolved by three cute little girls and be able to forget the Police. Still I decided that for my son (17 months old now) it is to early for PPG - he is fascinated with Krtek and as we are living in the city that Mojo, Fuzzy and even Him abandoned long ago because of high competence in violent crime field I do not see any need to introduce him to the concept of violence before time. As several quasi-monochromatic pink sequences flew in front of my eyes I decided to bring them to the PND! Blog - sugar, spice   everything nice are definitely fitting perfectly here. Above screen shot from Bubblevicious chapter in which "cute little bubbles decides to prove how hardcore she can be". On this very scene taking simulated fight test at Danger Level 11 - brilliant allusion to Spinal Tap:) Below couple of shots from The Bare Facts - both Emmy ("Outstanding Achievement in Animation") nominated episodes.
