A gdy ją ujrzał taką całą w groszkach  To mu się zrobiło jak po dobrych proszkach     Katarzyna Mirczak Znaki Specjalne (Polka Dots / Groszki)   Dear PINK's    Brutal Ink is on. I am heading home. I am very glad about this "double feature" – I belive that our projects support each other well and from all those "comparative typologies" we are showing one can clearly see that in this "Whole male universe", however chauvinist or even misogynistic it could get, the Woman keeps being central figure. Big Thanks to Sebastian   Nahuel for they interest, professionalism   friendship. A bunch of ink soaked flowers for Hank, Dan, Dejan and the whole Amsterdam Tattoo Museum crew for they participation. Above one more picture by Kasia - even the creepiest polka dots are pink in some way :)    PINK NOT DEAD! maurycy    check also:   BRUTAL PINK
