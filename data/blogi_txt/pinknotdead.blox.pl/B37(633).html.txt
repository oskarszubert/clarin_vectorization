Nunca dejas de jugar solo cambias de juguetes!    Detail of EROTIKA LOVE STORE stand at Sex   Entertainment Fair 2009   Dear PINK's    Once again I did Erotika Love Store stand at Sex   Entertainment Fair in Mexico City Palacio de los Deportes.* This time, as the crisis hit the globe, I had far less budget for the production than the past year so I decided to rely on very simple solution and it proved efficient: the whole facade is done with fluorescent pink and mirror silver. Last year light box was my main theme: 5 x 30 meters facade (the whole light box surface was over 200 m2) this time I used only two small light boxes for the entrances - the application is done with mirror- silver vinyl, the inside light is pink. I get new clothes for my Pink Dolls, also the capsule is much bigger this time - I must to admit that I liked better the cilindrical one but here the girls for sure have more comfort. Of course I would like to have an army of kittens and infinite resources to dress them still it was a nice re-encounter: Ale is a damn cute chick and Jenny keeps being real dance-machine :)    PINK NOT DEAD!    maurycy Glorious Glitter - Ale: The Pink Doll    Cute   Pink - Ale: The Pink Doll   check also:   MEXXXICO  Sex Fair 2007  Sex Fair 2008 Sex Fair 2009  EROTIKA LOVE STORE at PND!
